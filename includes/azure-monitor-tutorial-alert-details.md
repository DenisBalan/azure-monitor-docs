Provide an **Alert rule name**. This should be descriptive since it will be displayed when the alert is fired. Optionally provide a description that's included in the details of the alert.

Specify a subscription and resource group for the alert rule. This doesn't need to be in the same resource group as the resource that you're monitoring. 

Specify a **Severity** for the alert. The severity allows you to group alerts with a similar relative importance.
