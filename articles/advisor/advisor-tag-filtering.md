# Review optimization opportunities by a workload, environment or team

You can now get Advisor recommendations and scores scoped to a workload, environment, or team  using resource tag filters. Filter recommendations and calculate scores using tags you have already assigned to Azure resources, resource groups and subscriptions. Use tag filters to:
1.	Identify cost saving opportunities by team
2.	Compare scores for workloads to optimize the critical ones first

Note: For more information on how to use resource tags to organize and govern your Azure resources, please see the Cloud Adoption Frameworkâ€™s guidance and Build a cloud governance strategy on Azure module on Microsoft Learn.
