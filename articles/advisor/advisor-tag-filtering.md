# Review optimization opportunities by a workload, environment or team

You can now get Advisor recommendations and scores scoped to a workload, environment, or team  using resource tag filters. Filter recommendations and calculate scores using tags you have already assigned to Azure resources, resource groups and subscriptions. Use tag filters to:
1.	Identify cost saving opportunities by team
1.	Compare scores for workloads to optimize the critical ones first

> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to use resource tags to organize and govern your Azure resources, please see the [Cloud Adoption Frameworkâ€™s guidance](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/resource-tagging) and [Build a cloud governance strategy on Azure](/learn/modules/build-cloud-governance-strategy-azure/).
