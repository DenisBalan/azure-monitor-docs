# Calculate total cost savings

You can calculate aggregated potential yearly savings by following these steps: 

1. Sign in to the [**Azure portal**](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Search for and select [**Advisor**](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard) from any page.

1. Once there, navigate to the **Cost** tab on the left navigation menu and choose the option to **Download as CSV** to export cost recommendations. 

1. Leverage the cost savings amount for each recommendation to calculate aggregated potential yearly savings.

> [!NOTE]
> Recommendations show savings individually, and may overlap with the savings shown in other recommendations, for example â€“ you can only benefit from savings plans or reservations for virtual machines, but not from both.
