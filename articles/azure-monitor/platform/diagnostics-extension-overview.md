# Azure Diagnostics extension overview
The Azure Diagnostics extension is an agent in Azure that collects monitoring data from the guest operating system and workloads of Azure compute resources into Azure Monitor. This article provides an overview of Azure Diagnostics extension including specific functionality that it supports and installation options. Links are provided to other documentation for detailed information.



## Resources supported
The Azure Diagnostics extension can be used with any Azure compute resource which includes the following:

| Resource | Documentation |
|:---|:---|
| Azure Cloud Service (classic) Web and Worker Roles | [Introduction to Cloud Service Monitoring](../../cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-monitor.md)<br>[Enabling Azure Diagnostics in Azure Cloud Services](../../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics.md)<br>[Application Insights for Azure cloud services](../app/cloudservices.md)<br>[Trace the flow of a Cloud Services application with Azure Diagnostics](../../cloud-services/cloud-services-dotnet-diagnostics-trace-flow.md)<br> |
| Azure virtual machines | 
| Azure Service Fabric | [Monitor and diagnose services in a local machine development setup](../../service-fabric/service-fabric-diagnostics-how-to-monitor-and-diagnose-services-locally.md)


## Comparison to Log Analytics agent
The Log Analytics agent in Azure Monitor can also be used to collect monitoring data from the guest operating system of virtual machines. You may choose to use either or both depending on your requirements. The key differences to consider are:

- Azure Diagnostics Extension can be used only with Azure virtual machines. The Log Analytics agent can be used with virtual machines in Azure, other clouds, and on-premises.
- Azure Diagnostics extension can collect data to Azure Monitor Metrics. The Log Analytics agent primarily collects data to Azure Monitor Logs. Both can collect data to Azure Storage and Event Hubs.


## Windows and Linux
Separate extensions are available for Windows and for Linux. They both 




## Data collected
The Azure Diagnostics extension can collect the following types of data:

| Data Source | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Windows Event logs   | Information sent to the Windows event logging system. |
| Syslog               | Information sent to the Linux event logging system.   |
| Performance counters | Numerical values measuring performance of different aspects of operating system and workloads. |
| IIS Logs             | Usage information for IIS web sites running on the guest operating system. |
| Application logs     | Trace messages written by your application. |
| .NET EventSource logs |Code writing events using the .NET [EventSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource.aspx) class |
| [Manifest based ETW logs](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/desktop/etw/about-event-tracing) |Event Tracing for Windows events generated by any process.(1) |
| Crash dumps (logs)   | Information about the state of the process if an application crashes. |
| Custom error logs    | Logs created by your application or service. |
| Azure Diagnostic infrastructure logs | Information about Azure Diagnostics itself. |


## Data destinations



The Azure Diagnostic extension collects data into the locations in the following table. Follow the links for details on configuration.

| Destination | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Azure Storage | Writes logs and performance data to tables and blobs in an Azure Storage account. You can either view this data using one of multiple tools or collect it into Log Analytics workspace. See [Store and view diagnostic data in Azure Storage](diagnostics-extension-to-storage.md). |
| Azure Monitor Metrics | Collect performance data to the metrics database in Azure Monitor. See [Send Guest OS metrics to the Azure Monitor metric database](collect-custom-metrics-guestos-resource-manager-vm.md) for virtual machines.  |
| Event hubs | Use Azure Event Hubs to send data outside of Azure. See [Streaming Azure Diagnostics data to Event Hubs](diagnostics-extension-stream-event-hubs.md) |
| Azure Monitor Logs | Collect data from Azure Storage to a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor. See [Collect Azure diagnostic logs from Azure Storage](azure-storage-iis-table). |
| Application Insights | Collect data from applications running in your VM to Application Insights to integrate with other application monitoring. See [Send diagnostic data to Application Insights](diagnostics-extension-to-application-insights.md). |


## Installation options

### Azure portal


## Linux Agent
A [Linux version of the extension](../../virtual-machines/extensions/diagnostics-linux.md) is available for Virtual Machines running Linux. The statistics collected and behavior vary from the Windows version.


## Data storage





You also have the choice of sending your data to Azure Monitor metrics time-series database. At this time, this sink is only applicable to Performance Counters. It enables you to send performance counters in as custom metrics. This feature is in Preview. The Azure Monitor sink supports:
* Retrieving all performance counters sent to Azure Monitor via the [Azure Monitor metrics APIs.](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/monitor/)
* Alerting on all performance counters sent to Azure Monitor via the [metric alerts](../../azure-monitor/platform/alerts-overview.md) in Azure Monitor
* Treating wildcard operator in performance counters as the "Instance" dimension on your metric.  For example if you collected the "LogicalDisk(\*)/DiskWrites/sec" counter you would be able to filter and split on the "Instance" dimension to plot or alert on the Disk Writes/sec for each Logical Disk on the VM (for example, C:)

To learn more on how to configure this sink, refer to the [Azure diagnostics schema documentation.](diagnostics-extension-schema-1dot3.md)

## Costs
There is no cost for Azure Diagnostic Extension, but you may incur charges for the data ingested. Check [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for the destination where you're collecting data.

## Versioning and configuration schema
See [Azure Diagnostics Version History and Schema](diagnostics-extension-schema.md).
