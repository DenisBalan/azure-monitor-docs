# What is monitored by Azure Monitor
This article describes the different applications and services that are monitored by Azure Monitor. 

## Core insights and solutions
Core insights and solutions are considered part of Azure Monitor and follow the same support and service level agreement. They are supported in all Azure regions where Azure Monitor is available.

### Insights
Insights provide a customized monitoring experience for particular applications and services. They collect and analyze both logs and metrics.

| Insight | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Application Insights](../app/app-insights-overview.md) | Extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service to monitor your live web application on any platform. |
| [Azure Monitor for Containers](../insights/container-insights-overview.md) | Monitors the performance of container workloads deployed to either Azure Container Instances or managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). |
| [Azure Monitor for Cosmos DB](../insights/cosmosdb-insights-overview.md) | Provides a view of the overall performance, failures, capacity, and operational health of all your Azure Cosmos DB resources in a unified interactive experience. |
| [Azure Monitor for Networks (preview)](../insights/network-insights-overview.md) | Provides a comprehensive view of health and metrics for all your network resource. The advanced search capability helps you identify resource dependencies, enabling scenarios like identifying resource that are hosting your website, by simply searching for your website name. |
[Azure Monitor for Resource Groups (preview)](../insights/resource-group-insights.md) |  Triage and diagnose any problems your individual resources encounter, while offering context as to the health and performance of the resource group as a whole. |
| [Azure Monitor for Storage](../insights/storage-insights-overview.md) | Provides comprehensive monitoring of your Azure Storage accounts by delivering a unified view of your Azure Storage services performance, capacity, and availability. |
| [Azure Monitor for VMs (preview)](../insights/container-insights-overview.md) | Monitors your Azure virtual machines (VM) and virtual machine scale sets at scale. It analyzes the performance and health of your Windows and Linux VMs, and monitors their processes and dependencies on other resources and external processes. |

### Solutions
Solutions are based on log queries and views customized for a particular application or service. They collect and analyze logs only and are being deprecated over time in favor of insights.

| Solution | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Activity log analytics](activity-log-view.md#activity-logs-analytics-monitoring-solution) | Analyze Activity log entries using predefined log queries and views. |
| [Agent health](../insights/solution-agenthealth.md) | Analyze the health and configuration of Log Analytics agents. |
| [Alert management](alert-management-solution.md) | Analyze alerts collected from System Center Operations Manager, Nagios, or Zabbix. |
| [Network Performance Monitor](../insights/network-performance-monitor.md) |  Monitor network performance between various points in your network infrastructure, network connectivity to service and application endpoints, and the performance of Azure ExpressRoute. |
| [Service Map](../insights/service-map.md) | Automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. The same functionality is provided in   |
| [Wire Data](../insights/wire-data.md) | Consolidated network and performance data collected from Windows-connected and Linux-connected computers with the Log Analytics agent. |


## Other solutions
Other solutions are available for monitoring different applications and services, but they may not follow the same support and service level agreements as Azure Monitor. 

| Solution | Description |
|:---|:---|
| [Active Directory assessment](../insights/ad-assessment.md) | Assess the risk and health of your Active Directory environments. |
