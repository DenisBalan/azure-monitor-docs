# Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor
Data collected by Azure Monitor is stored as either [Logs](data-platform-logs.md) or [Metrics](data-platform-metrics.md). This article provides a reference of the different sources of data for Azure Monitor. Use this article to determine how your particular application or service is monitored.


## Collection patterns
All data collected by Azure Monitor will fit into one of the patterns described in the following table. Different applications and services will support different patterns. 

| Pattern | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Platform metrics | Platform metrics are automatically collected for Azure services that support them. |
| Diagnostic settings | Diagnostic settings collect platform logs and metrics to Azure Monitor Logs and to send to destinations outside of Azure Monitor. |
| Insights | Insights provide a customized monitoring experience for particular applications and services. They collect and analyze both logs and metrics. |
| Solutions | Solutions are based on log queries and views customized for a particular application or service. They collect and analyze logs only and are being deprecated over time in favor of insights. |
| Agents | Compute resources such as virtual machines require an agent to collect logs and metrics from their guest operating system. |
| API | Separate APIs are available to write data to Azure Monitor Logs and Metrics from any REST API client. |
