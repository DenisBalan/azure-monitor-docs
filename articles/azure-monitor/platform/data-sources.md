# Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor
Azure Monitor is based on a [common monitoring data platform](data-platform.md) that includes [Logs](data-platform-logs.md) and [Metrics](data-platform-metrics.md). Collecting data into this platform allows data from multiple resources to be analyzed together using a common set of tools in Azure Monitor. There are also other locations where monitoring data may be sent to support other scenarios, and some resources may write to other locations before they can be collected into Metrics and Logs.

This article describes the monitoring data created by Azure resources and the different sources of monitoring data collected by Azure Monitor. Links are provided to detailed information on configuration required to collect this data to different locations.

## Application tiers

Monitoring data from Azure applications can be organized into tiers, the highest tiers being your application itself and the lower tiers being components of Azure platform. The method of accessing data from each tier varies. The application tiers are summarized in the table below, and the sources of monitoring data in each tier are presented in the following sections.


![Monitoring tiers](../media/overview/overview.png)


### Azure
The application tiers in the following table are specific to Azure.

| Tier | Description | Collection method |

| EventHubs | Export Diagnostic logs to Event Hub for redirection to other services. |[Stream Azure Diagnostic Logs to an event hub](diagnostic-logs-stream-event-hubs.md) |



### Other services
The Azure services in the following table do not currently store their data in the Azure Monitor data platform like other services.

| Service | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Storage | Metrics for storage accounts are collected in Azure Monitor along with other resources, but logs are written to the storage account](../../storage/common/storage-metrics-in-azure-monitor.md). You can import these logs into a Log Analytics workspace in Azure Monitor, but this requires custom configuration. You can also retrieve this data with the Storage Analytics API.  | [Azure Storage metrics in Azure Monitor](../../storage/common/storage-metrics-in-azure-monitor.md)<br>[Azure Storage analytics logging](../../storage/common/storage-analytics-logging.md)<br>[Storage Analytics API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/storage-analytics)<br>[Query Azure Storage analytics logs in Azure Log Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/query-azure-storage-analytics-logs-in-azure-log-analytics/) |
| App Service | Metrics for app services are collected in Azure Monitor along with other resources. Logs are written to file, table, or blob storage. | [Enable diagnostics logging for apps in Azure App Service](../../app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs.md)  |



## Guest operating system
Compute resources in Azure, in other clouds, and on-premises have a guest operating system to monitor. With the installation of one or more agents, you can gather telemetry from the guest into the same monitoring tools as the Azure services themselves.

![Azure compute resource collection](media/data-sources/compute-resources.png)

### Azure Diagnostic extension
Enabling the Azure Diagnostics extension for Azure Virtual machines allows you to collect logs and metrics from Azure compute resources including Azure Cloud Service (classic) Web and Worker Roles, Virtual Machines, Virtual Machine scale sets, and Service Fabric.

| Destination | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Storage | When you enable the Diagnostics Extension, it will write to a storage account by default. | [Store and view diagnostic data in Azure Storage](diagnostics-extension-to-storage.md) |
| Event Hubs | Configure the Diagnostics Extension to send to Event Hubs to stream the data to other locations.  | [Streaming Azure Diagnostics data in the hot path by using Event Hubs](diagnostics-extension-stream-event-hubs.md) |

| Azure Monitor Metrics | When you configure the Diagnostics Extension to collect performance counters, they are written to the Azure Monitor metrics database. | [Send Guest OS metrics to the Azure Monitor metric store using a Resource Manager template for a Windows virtual machine](collect-custom-metrics-guestos-resource-manager-vm.md) |


### Log Analytics agent 
Comprehensive monitoring and management of your Windows or Linux virtual machines or physical computer is delivered with the Log Analytics agent. The virtual machine can be running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises.

| Destination | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Azure Monitor Logs | The Log Analytics agent connects to Azure Monitor either directly or through System Center Operations Manager and allows you to collect data from data sources that you configure or from monitoring solutions that provide additional insights into applications running on the virtual machine. | [Agent data sources in Azure Monitor](agent-data-sources.md)<br>[Monitoring solutions in Azure Monitor](../insights/solutions.md) |


### Azure Monitor for VMs 
[Azure Monitor for VMs](../insights/vminsights-overview.md) provides a customized monitoring experience for virtual machines providing features beyond core Azure Monitor functionality, including service status and VM health. It requires a Dependency Agent on Windows and Linux virtual machines that integrates with the Log Analytics agent to collect discovered data about processes running on the virtual machine and external process dependencies.

| Destination | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Azure Monitor Logs | Stores data about processes and dependencies on the agent. | [Using Azure Monitor for VMs (preview) Map to understand application components](../../insights/vminsights-maps.md) |

## Applications
Detailed application monitoring in Azure Monitor is done with [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/application-insights/) which collects data from applications running on a variety of platforms. The application can be running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises.

![Application data collection](media/data-sources/applications.png)


### Application data
When you enable Application Insights for an application by installing an instrumentation package, it collects metrics and logs related to the performance and operation of the application. Application Insights stores the data it collects in the same Azure Monitor data platform used by other data sources. It includes extensive tools for analyzing this data, but you can also analyze it with data from other sources using tools such as Metrics Explorer and Log Analytics.

| Destination | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Azure Monitor Logs | Application Insights supports multiple kinds of data in Azure Monitor Logs:<br>- Operational data about your application including page views, application requests, and exceptions.<br>- Dependency information between application components to support Application Map and telemetry correlation.<br>- Results of availability tests that test the availability and responsiveness of your application from different locations on the public Internet. |[Analyze log data in Azure Monitor](../../log-query/log-query-overview.md)<br>[Application Map](../../app/app-map.md)<br>[Telemetry correlation in Application Insights](../../app/correlation.md)<br>[Monitor availability and responsiveness of any web site](../../app/monitor-web-app-availability.md) |
| Azure Monitor Metrics | Application Insights collects metrics describing the performance and operation of the application in addition to custom metrics that you define in your application into the Azure Monitor metrics database. | [Log-based and pre-aggregated metrics in Application Insights](../../app/pre-aggregated-metrics-log-metrics.md)<br>[Application Insights API for custom events and metrics](../../app/api-custom-events-metrics.md) |

You can also use Application Insights to [create a custom metric](../../application-insights/app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md).  This allows you to define your own logic for calculating a numeric value and then storing that value with other metrics that can be accessed from metric analytics and used for [Autoscale](autoscale-custom-metric.md) and metric alerts. |
| Azure Storage | Archive application data to storage by configuring [continuous export](/../../app/export-telemetry.md). |


## Monitoring Solutions and Insights
[Monitoring solutions](../insights/solutions.md) and Insights collect data to provide additional insight into the operation of a particular service or application. They may address resources in different application tiers and even multiple tiers.

## Monitoring solutions

| Destination | Description | Reference
|:---|:---|:---|
| Azure Monitor Logs | Monitoring solutions collect data into Azure Monitor logs where it may be analyzed using the query language or [views](view-designer.md) that are typically included in the solution. | [Data collection details for monitoring solutions in Azure](../../insights/solutions-inventory.md)<br>[Analyze log data in Azure Monitor](../log-query/log-query-overview.md) |

### Azure Monitor for VMs
A description of the data collected by Azure Monitor for VMs is included in the [Guest Operating System](#guest-operating-system) section above.

### Azure Monitor for Containers
[Azure Monitor for Containers](../insights/container-insights-overview.md) provides a customized monitoring experience for [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/). It collects additional data about these resources described in the following table.

| Container Diagnostics | Audit log and control plane logs are stored in a custom location before they're moved to a Log Analytics workspace. |  |
| Azure Kubernetes Service | In order to a near real time experience, Azure Monitor for Containers presents data directly from the Azure Kubernetes service in the Azure portal. | [How to view container logs real time with Azure Monitor for containers (preview)](../../insights/container-insights-live-logs.md) |

## Custom sources
In addition to the standard tiers of an application, you may need to monitor other resources that have telemetry that can't be collected with the other data sources. For these resources, you need to write this data using an Azure Monitor API.

| Destination | Method | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Azure Monitor Logs | Data Collector API | Collect log data from any REST client and store in Log Analytics workspace. | [Send log data to Azure Monitor with the HTTP Data Collector API (public preview)](data-collector-api.md) |
| Azure Monitor Metrics | Custom Metrics API | Collect metric data from any REST client and store in Azure Monitor metrics database. | [Send custom metrics for an Azure resource to the Azure Monitor metric store by using a REST API](metrics-store-custom-rest-api.md) |


## Other services
Other services in Azure write data to the Azure Monitor data platform. This allows you to analyze data collected by these services with data collected by Azure Monitor and leverage the same analysis and visualization tools.

| Service | Destination | Description | Reference |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| [Azure Security Center](/azure/security-center/) | Azure Monitor Logs | Azure Security Center stores the data it collects in a Log Analytics workspace which allows it to be analyzed with other log data collected by Azure Monitor.  | [Data collection in Azure Security Center](../../security-center/security-center-enable-data-collection.md) |
| [Azure Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/) | Azure Monitor Logs | Azure Sentinel stores the data it collects in a Log Analytics workspace which allows it to be analyzed with other log data collected by Azure Monitor. Certain data sources that you add to Azure Sentinel will add monitoring solutions to the workspace. |  |
