# Action rules (preview)

Action rules allow you to define or suppress actions at any Azure Resource Manager scope (Azure subscription, resource group, or target resource). They have a variety of filters that allow you to narrow down the specific subset of alert instances that you want to act on.

## Why and when should you use action rules?

### Suppression of alerts

There are many scenarios where it's useful to suppress the notifications generated by alerts, which range from suppression during a planned maintenance window to suppression during nonbusiness hours. For example, the team responsible for  **ContosoVM** wants to suppress alert notifications for the upcoming weekend, because **ContosoVM** is undergoing a planned maintenance. Although the team can disable each alert rule configured on **ContosoVM** manually (and enable it again after the maintenance), that's not a simple process. Action rules allow you to define alert suppression at scale with the ability to flexibly configure the period of suppression. In the previous example, the team can define one action rule on **ContosoVM** that suppresses all alert notifications for the weekend.


### Actions at scale

Although alert rules allow you to define the action group that triggers when the alert is generated, customers often have a common action group across their scope of operations. For example, a team responsible for the resource group **ContosoRG** will probably define the same action group for all alert rules defined within **ContosoRG**. Action rules allow you to simplify this process by defining actions at scale, so that an action group can be triggered for any alert generated on the configured scope. In the previous example, the team can define one action rule on **ContosoRG** that will trigger the same action group for all alerts generated within it.

> Action rules currently do not apply to Service Health alerts.

## Configuring an action rule

You can access the feature by selecting **Manage actions** from the **Alerts** landing page in Azure Monitor. Then, select **Action rules (preview)**. You can access the rules by selecting **Action rules (preview)** from the dashboard of the landing page for Alerts.

![Action rules from the Azure Monitor landing page](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-landing-page.png)

Select **+ New Action Rule**. 

![Add new action rule](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-new-rule.png)

Alternatively, you can create an action rule while configuring an alert rule.

![Add new action rule](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-alert-rule.png)

You should now see the action rule creation flow page. Configure the following elements: 

![New action rule creation flow](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-new-rule-creation-flow.png)

### Scope

First choose the scope (Azure subscription, resource group, or target resource). You also have the ability to multiple-select a combination of any of the above (within a single subscription).

![Action rule scope](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-new-rule-creation-flow-scope.png)

### Filter criteria

You can additionally define filter(s) to further narrow down to a specific subset of the alerts on the defined scope. 

The available filters are: 

* **Severity**: The option to select one or more alert severities. **Severity = Sev1** means that the action rule is applicable for all alerts set to Sev1.
* **Monitor Service**: A filter based on the originating monitoring service. This is also multiple-select. For example, **Monitor Service = “Application Insights”** means that the action rule is applicable for all “Application Insights”-based alerts.
* **Resource Type**:  A filter based on a specific resource type. This is also multiple-select. For example, **Resource Type = “Virtual Machines”** means that the action rule is applicable for all virtual machines.
* **Alert Rule ID**: An option to filter for specific alert rules by using the Resource Manager ID of the alert rule.
* **Monitor Condition**:  A filter for alert instances with either **Fired** or **Resolved** as the monitor condition.
* **Description**: A regex (regular expression) match within the description defined as part of the alert rule.
* **Alert Context (payload)**: A regex match within the [alert context](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-common-schema-definitions#alert-context-fields) fields of an alert instance.

These filters are applied in conjunction with one another. For example, if you set **Resource type' = Virtual Machines** and **Severity' = Sev0**, then you've filtered for all **Sev0** alerts on only your VMs.

### Suppression or action group configuration

Next, configure the action rule for either alert suppression or action group support. You cannot choose both. The configuration acts on all alert instances that match the previously defined scope and filters.

#### Suppression

If you select **suppression**, configure the duration for the suppression of actions and notifications. Choose one of the following:
* **From now (Always)**: Suppresses all notifications indefinitely.
* **At a scheduled time**: Suppresses notifications within a bounded duration.
* **With a recurrence**: Suppresses notifications on a recurring daily, weekly, or monthly schedule.

#### Action group

If you select **Action group** in the toggle, either add an existing action group or create a new one. 

> [!NOTE]
> You can associate only one action group with an action rule.

### Action rule details

Lastly, configure the following details for the action rule:
* Name
* Resource group in which it's saved
* Description 

## Example scenarios

### Scenario 1: Suppression of alerts based on severity

**Contoso** wants to suppress notifications for all Sev4 alerts on all VMs within their subscription **ContosoSub** every weekend.

**Solution:** Create an action rule with
* Scope = **ContosoSub**
* Filters
    * Severity = **Sev4**
    * Resource Type = **Virtual Machines**
* Suppression with recurrence set to weekly, and **Saturday** and **Sunday** checked

### Scenario 2: Suppression of alerts based on alert context (payload)

**Contoso** wants to suppress notifications for all log alerts generated for **Computer-01** in **ContosoSub** indefinitely as it's going through maintenance.

**Solution:** Create an action rule with
* Scope = **ContosoSub**
* Filters
    * Monitor Service = **Log Analytics**
    * Alert Context (payload) contains **Computer-01**
* Suppression set to **From now (Always)**

### Scenario 3: Action group defined at a resource group

**Contoso** has defined [a metric alert at a subscription level](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-metric-overview#monitoring-at-scale-using-metric-alerts-in-azure-monitor). But it wants to define the actions that trigger specifically for alerts generated from their resource group **ContosoRG**.

**Solution:** Create an action rule with
* Scope = **ContosoRG**
* No filters
* Action group set to **ContosoActionGroup**

> [!NOTE]
> **Action groups defined within action rules and alert rules operate independently, with no deduplication.** In the scenario described above, if there's an action group defined for the alert rule, it triggers in conjunction with the action group defined in the action rule. 

## Managing your action rules

You can view and manage your action rules from the list view, as shown below:

![Action rules list view](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-list-view.png)

From here, you can enable, disable, or delete action rules at scale by selecting the checkbox next to them. When you select an action rule, its configuration page opens, which allows you to update its definition and enable or disable it.

## Best practices

Log alerts that you create with the [number of results](alerts-unified-log.md) option generate **a single alert instance** by using the whole search result (which could span across multiple computers). In this scenario, if an action rule uses the **Alert Context (payload)** filter, it acts on the alert instance as long as there's a match. In Scenario 2, described previously, if the search results for the generated log alert contain both **Computer-01** and **Computer-02**, the entire notification is suppressed (that is, there's no notification generated for **Computer-02** at all).

![Action rules and log alerts (number of results)](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-log-alert-number-of-results.png)

To best use log alerts with action rules, create log alerts with the [metric measurement](alerts-unified-log.md) option. Separate alert instances are generated by this option, based on its defined group field. Then, in Scenario 2, separate alert instances are generated for **Computer-01** and **Computer-02**. Due to the action rule described in the scenario, only the notification for **Computer-01** is suppressed, while the notification for **Computer-02** continues to fire as normal.

## FAQ

* Q. While configuring an action rule, I'd like to see all the possible overlapping action rules, so that I avoid duplicate notifications. Is it possible to do so?

    A. After you define a scope while configuring an action rule, you can see a list of action rules that overlap on the same scope (if any). This overlap can be one of the following options:
    * An exact match: For example, the action rule you're defining and the overlapping action rule are on the same subscription.
    * A subset: For example, the action rule you're defining is on a subscription, and the overlapping action rule is on a resource group within the subscription.
    * A superset: For example, the action rule you're defining is on a resource group, and the overlapping action rule is on the subscription that contains the resource group.
    * An intersection: For example, the action rule you're defining is on **VM1** and **VM2**, and the overlapping action rule is on **VM2** and **VM3**.

    ![Overlapping action rules](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-overlapping.png)

* Q. While configuring an alert rule, is it possible to know if there are already action rules defined that might act on the alert rule I'm defining?

    A. After you define the target resource for your alert rule, you can see the list of action rules that act on the same scope (if any) by selecting **View configured actions** under the **Actions** section. This list is populated based on the following scenarios for the scope:
    * An exact match: For example, the alert rule you're defining and the action rule are on the same subscription.
    * A subset: For example, the alert rule you're defining is on a subscription, and the action rule is on a resource group within the subscription.
    * A superset: For example, the alert rule you're defining is on a resource group, and the action rule is on the subscription that contains the resource group.
    * An intersection: For example, the alert rule you're defining is on **VM1** and **VM2**, and the action rule is on **VM2** and **VM3**.
    
    ![Overlapping action rules](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-alert-rule-overlapping.png)

* Q. Can I see the alerts that have been suppressed by an action rule?

    A. In the [alerts list page](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/platform/alerts-managing-alert-instances), there's an additional column that can be chosen called **Suppression Status**. If the notification for an alert instance was suppressed, it would show that status in the list.

    ![Suppressed alert instances](media/alerts-action-rules/action-rules-suppressed-alerts.png)

* Q. If there's an action rule with an action group and another with suppression active on the same scope, what happens?

    A. Suppression always takes precedence on the same scope.

* Q. What happens if I have a resource that's monitored in two separate action rules? Do I get one or two notifications? For example, **VM2** in the following scenario:

      action rule AR1 defined for VM1 and VM2 with action group AG1
      action rule AR2 defined for VM2 and VM3 with action group AG1

    A. For every alert on **VM1** and **VM3**, action group **AG1** would be triggered once. For every alert on **VM2**, action group **AG1** would be triggered twice, because action rules do not deduplicate actions) 

* Q. What happens if I have a resource monitored in two separate action rules and one calls for action while another for suppression? For example, **VM2** in the following scenario:

      action rule AR1 defined for VM1 and VM2 with action group AG1 
      action rule AR2 defined for VM2 and VM3 with suppression

    A. For every alert on **VM1**, action group **AG1** would be triggered once. Actions and notifications for every alert on **VM2** and **VM3** will be suppressed. 

* Q. What happens if I have an alert rule and an action rule defined for the same resource calling different action groups? For example, **VM1** in the following scenario:

      alert rule rule1 on VM1 with action group AG2
      action rule AR1 defined for VM1 with action group AG1 
 
    A. For every alert on **VM1**, action group **AG1** would be triggered once. Whenever alert rule **rule1** is triggered, it will also trigger **AG2** additionally. Action groups defined within action rules and alert rules operate independently, with no deduplication.
