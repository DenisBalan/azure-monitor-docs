# Add a nested health model in Azure Health Models

Azure Health Models allows adding nested health models to a health model. This functionality can be helpful for some scenarios like more complex environments, meta-models or centralized health models that don't need the full level of detail.

A "nested health model" is the representation of another health model as a single entity.

## Add a nested health model

A "nested health model" is added like any other resource.

1. Click on "+ Add" in the [Designer view](./health-model-create-modify-with-designer.md) and select "Azure resources".

1. In the "Select resources to add" dialog, search for the health model resource you want to add:

1. Select one and add it to your health model.

   The newly added (nested) health model is shown as any other resource.

   It provides you with three different metrics:

   | Metric option | Description |
   |:-------|:------------|
   | **Overall health score** | Represents the health score of the whole nested health model. |
   | **Health score per node** | Allows you to select the health score from a specific entity within the selected health model, by applying the respective _Dimension_ and filtering. |
   | **Query execution duration** | Contains the overall duration the execution of all configured queries in a health model. |
