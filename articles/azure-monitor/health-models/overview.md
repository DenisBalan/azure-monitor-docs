# Health models in Azure Monitor (preview)

Azure Health Models is a feature in Azure Monitor that enables you to create and manage health models for your Azure resources. Health models are a representation of the health of your Azure resources and their dependencies. They can be used to monitor the health of your resources and to create alerts based on the health state of your resources.
