The graph view shows the latest snapshot of a health model in its full structural representation.

The _Generated_ timestamp on the top indicates the following about the snapshot:

- When this snapshot was taken 
- What the current refresh rate for the model is (that is, how often snapshots are being taken).

When you click on an entity, you can see more detail like its health state history.
