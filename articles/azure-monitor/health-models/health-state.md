# View the health state of a health model

The table view shows the health state of one or more layers of your health model over time. The view starts by only showing the top entity ("root") and you can gradually expand from there.

When you change the date window, the displayed time grain gets automatically chosen.

You can click on a particular time slice to get more information and also to zoom in on that date range.
