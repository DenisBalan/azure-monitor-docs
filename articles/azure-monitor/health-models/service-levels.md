# Service levels in Azure Monitor health models (preview)

The service level view gives you an overview of the attained service level of your workload visualized in your health model. It shows you the healthy, unknown, degraded and unhealthy states. Only unhealthy states are considered not attained.

The table in the upper right corner shows you the configured "Service Level Objective", the "Attained Service Level" and the "Remaining Error Budget", which represents the difference between the attained and the configured Service Level.
