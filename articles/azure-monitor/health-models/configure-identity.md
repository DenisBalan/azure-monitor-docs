# Configure the Managed Identity for a health model

Every health model requires one Managed Identity to execute all signal queries against data sources. You can **either** use the _System assigned_ identity (recommended during Preview), or **one** _User assigned_ identity.

In most cases, you configure this identity during the creation wizard already. However, you can also change health model identity at a later point using the Identity pane.

## Switch the Managed Identity

If you want to switch from System assigned identity to User assigned, **disable the System assigned first** (set the status to Off), before adding a User assigned identity.

While the UI allows you to add multiple User assigned identities, make sure you **only add one** during the preview phase.
