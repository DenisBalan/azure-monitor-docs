# Adding a query to your Azure Workbook

Azure Workbooks allow you to query any of the supported workbook [data sources](workbooks-data-soureces.md), or you can [combine data sources](workbooks-combine-data) to monitor your Azure resources. 

For example, you can query Azure Resource Health that helps you view any service problems affecting your resources, or you can query Azure Monitor Metrics, which are numeric data that is collected at regular intervals and describe some aspect of a system at a particular time.

## Add a query to an Azure Workbook

1. In your Workbook:
    - If this is a new Workbook, select **Add** and then **Add query**.
    - If this is an existing Workbook:
        - Select **Edit**.
        - Select the ellipsis **...** to the right of the **Edit** button next to one of the elements in the Workbook.
        - Select **Add** and then **Add query**.
