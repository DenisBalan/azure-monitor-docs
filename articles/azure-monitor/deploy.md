# Deploy Azure Monitor
This guide provides recommended guidance for deploying Azure Monitor to monitor the performance and availability of your cloud and hybrid applications and resources. Enabling Azure Monitor to monitor of all your Azure resources is a combination of configuring Azure Monitor components and configuring Azure resources to generate monitoring data for Azure Monitor to collect. 

The goal of a complete implementation of Azure Monitor is to collect all available data from all of your cloud resources and applications and enable as many features in Azure Monitor as possible based on that data.

You may have additional requirements such as monitoring resources outside of Azure and sending data outside of Azure Monitor. Requirements such as these can be achieved with additional configuration of the features described in this scenario. Follow the links to documentation in each step for additional configuration options.
