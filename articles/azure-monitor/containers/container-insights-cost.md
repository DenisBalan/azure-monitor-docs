# Understand monitoring costs for Container insights

This article provides pricing guidance for Container insights to help you understand how to:

* Estimate costs up-front before you enable Container Insights.
* Measure costs after Container insights has been enabled for one or more containers.
* Control the collection of data and make cost reductions.

Azure Monitor Logs collects, indexes, and stores data generated by your Kubernetes cluster.

The Azure Monitor pricing model is primarily based on the amount of data ingested in gigabytes per day into your Log Analytics workspace. The cost of a Log Analytics workspace isn't based only on the volume of data collected. It's also dependent on the plan selected and how long you chose to store data generated from your clusters.

>[!NOTE]
>All sizes and pricing are for sample estimation only. See the Azure Monitor [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) page for the most recent pricing based on your Azure Monitor Log Analytics pricing model and Azure region.

The following list is a summary of what types of data are collected from a Kubernetes cluster with Container insights that influences cost and can be customized based on your usage:

- Stdout, stderr container logs from every monitored container in every Kubernetes namespace in the cluster
- Container environment variables from every monitored container in the cluster
- Completed Kubernetes jobs/pods in the cluster that don't require monitoring
- Active scraping of Prometheus metrics
- [Diagnostic log collection](../../aks/monitor-aks.md#configure-monitoring) of Kubernetes master node logs in your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to analyze log data generated by master components, such as the `kube-apiserver` and `kube-controller-manager`.

## What is collected from Kubernetes clusters?

Container insights includes a predefined set of metrics and inventory items collected that are written as log data in your Log Analytics workspace. All metrics listed here are collected every minute.

### Node metrics collected

The following list contains the 24 metrics per node that are collected:

- cpuUsageNanoCores
- cpuCapacityNanoCores
- cpuAllocatableNanoCores
- memoryRssBytes
- memoryWorkingSetBytes
- memoryCapacityBytes
- memoryAllocatableBytes
- restartTimeEpoch
- used (disk)
- free (disk)
- used_percent (disk)
- io_time (diskio)
- writes (diskio)
- reads (diskio)
- write_bytes (diskio)
- write_time (diskio)
- iops_in_progress (diskio)
- read_bytes (diskio)
- read_time (diskio)
- err_in (net)
- err_out (net)
- bytes_recv (net)
- bytes_sent (net)
- Kubelet_docker_operations (kubelet)

### Container metrics

The following list contains the eight metrics per container collected:

- cpuUsageNanoCores
- cpuRequestNanoCores
- cpuLimitNanoCores
- memoryRssBytes
- memoryWorkingSetBytes
- memoryRequestBytes
- memoryLimitBytes
- restartTimeEpoch

### Cluster inventory

The following list contains the cluster inventory data collected by default:

- KubePodInventory: 1 per pod per minute
- KubeNodeInventory: 1 per node per minute
- KubeServices: 1 per service per minute
- ContainerInventory: 1 per container per minute

## Estimate costs to monitor your AKS cluster

The following estimation is based on an AKS cluster with the following sizing example. Also, the estimate applies only for metrics and inventory data collected. For container logs like stdout, stderr, and environmental variables, it varies based on the log sizes generated by the workload. They're excluded from our estimation.

If you enabled monitoring of an AKS cluster configured as follows:

- Three nodes
- Two disks per node
- One network interface per node
- 20 pods (one container in each pod = 20 containers in total)
- Two Kubernetes namespaces
- Five Kubernetes services (includes kube-system pods, services, and namespace)
- Collection frequency = 60 secs (default)

You can see the tables and volume of data generated per hour in the assigned Log Analytics workspace. For more information about each of these tables, see [Azure Monitor Logs tables](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables).

|Table | Size estimate (MB/hour) |
|------|---------------|
|Perf | 12.9 |
|InsightsMetrics | 11.3 |
|KubePodInventory | 1.5 |
|KubeNodeInventory | 0.75 |
|KubeServices | 0.13 |
|ContainerInventory | 3.6 |
|KubeHealth | 0.1 |
|KubeMonAgentEvents |0.005 |

Total = 31 MB/hour = 23.1 GB/month (one month = 31 days)

Using the default [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/) for Log Analytics, which is a pay-as-you-go model, you can estimate the Azure Monitor cost per month. After including a capacity reservation, the price would be higher per month depending on the reservation selected.

## Control ingestion to reduce cost

Consider a scenario where your organization's different business unit shares Kubernetes infrastructure and a Log Analytics workspace. Each business unit is separated by a Kubernetes namespace. You can visualize how much data is ingested in each workspace by using the **Data Usage** runbook, which is available from the **View Workbooks** dropdown list.

[![Screenshot that shows the View Workbooks dropdown list.](media/container-insights-cost/workbooks-dropdown.png)](media/container-insights-cost/workbooks-dropdown.png#lightbox)

This workbook helps you visualize the source of your data without having to build your own library of queries from what we share in our documentation. In this workbook, there are charts with which you can view billable data from such perspectives as the:

- Total billable data ingested in GB by solution.
- Billable data ingested by Container logs (application logs).
- Billable container logs data ingested by Kubernetes namespace.
- Billable container logs data ingested segregated by Cluster name.
- Billable container log data ingested by log source entry.
- Billable diagnostic data ingested by diagnostic master node logs.

To learn about managing rights and permissions to the workbook, review [Access control](../visualize/workbooks-overview.md#access-control).

After you complete your analysis to determine which source or sources are generating the most data or more data that are exceeding your requirements, you can reconfigure data collection. For more information on configuring collection of stdout, stderr, and environmental variables, see [Configure agent data collection settings](container-insights-agent-config.md).

The following examples show what changes you can apply to your cluster by modifying the ConfigMap file to help control cost.

1. Disable stdout logs across all namespaces in the cluster by modifying the following in the ConfigMap file for the Azure Container Insights service pulling the metrics:

    ```
    [log_collection_settings]       
       [log_collection_settings.stdout]          
          enabled = false
    ```

1. Disable collecting stderr logs from your development namespace, for example, **dev-test**. Continue collecting stderr logs from other namespaces (for example, **prod** and **default**) by modifying the following in the ConfigMap file:

    >[!NOTE]
    >The kube-system log collection is disabled by default. The default setting is retained, adding **dev-test** namespace to the list of exclusion namespaces is applied to stderr log collection.

    ```
    [log_collection_settings.stderr]          
       enabled = true          
          exclude_namespaces = ["kube-system", "dev-test"]
    ```

1. Disable environment variable collection across the cluster by modifying the following in the ConfigMap file. This is applicable to all containers in every Kubernetes namespace. 

    ```
    [log_collection_settings.env_var]
        enabled = false
    ```

1. To clean up completed jobs, specify the cleanup policy in the job definition by modifying the following in the ConfigMap file:

    ```
    apiVersion: batch/v1
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: pi-with-ttl
    spec:
      ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
    ```

After applying one or more of these changes to your ConfigMaps, apply it to your cluster withe the command `kubectl apply -f <config3. map_yaml_file.yaml>`. For example, run the command `kubectl apply -f container-azm-ms-agentconfig.yaml` to open the file in your default editor to modify and then save it.

### Prometheus metrics scraping

If you are utilizing [Prometheus metric scraping](container-insights-prometheus.md), ensure you consider the following to limit the number of metrics that you collect from your cluster:

- Ensure scraping frequency is set optimally (the default is 60 seconds). While you can increase the frequency to 15 seconds, you need to ensure that the metrics you are scraping are published at that frequency. Otherwise there will be many duplicate metrics scraped and sent to your Log Analytics workspace at intervals adding to data ingestion and retention costs, but are of less value. 

- Container insights supports exclusion & inclusion lists by metric name. For example, if you are scraping **kubedns** metrics in your cluster, there might be hundreds of them that gets scraped by default, but you are most likely only interested in a subset. Confirm you specified a list of metrics to scrape, or exclude others except a few to save on data ingestion volume. It is easy to enable scraping and not use many of those metrics, which will only add additional charges to your Log Analytics bill.

- When scraping through pod annotations, ensure you filter by namespace so that you exclude scraping of pod metrics from namespaces that you don't use (for example, **dev-test** namespace).
 
### Configure Basic Logs

You can save on data ingestion costs by configuring certain tables in your Log Analytics workspace that you primarily use for debugging, troubleshooting, and auditing as Basic Logs. For more information, including the limitations of Basic Logs, see [Configure Basic Logs (preview)](../best-practices-cost.md#configure-basic-logs-preview). ContainerLogV2 is the configured version of Basic Logs that Container Insights uses. ContainerLogV2 includes verbose text-based log records.

You must be on the ContainerLogV2 schema to configure Basic Logs. For more information, see [Enable the ContainerLogV2 schema (preview)](container-insights-logging-v2.md).
