On May 31, 2022 Container Insights support for Azure Red Hat OpenShift v4.x will be retired. If you use the script-based model of Container Insights for Azure Red Hat OpenShift v4.x, make sure to transition to Container Insights on [Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes](../../azure-arc/kubernetes/overview.md) prior to that date.
