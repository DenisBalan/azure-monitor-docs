# Monitor Kubernetes clusters with Azure services

This article describes how to monitor the health and performance of your Kubernetes clusters and the workloads running on them using the configuration described in [Configure Kubernetes monitoring using Azure services](monitor-kubernetes-configure.md).



## Layers of Kubernetes environment

Following is an illustration of a common bottoms-up approach of a typical Kubernetes environment, starting from infrastructure up through applications. Each layer has distinct monitoring requirements that are addressed by different Azure services. Configuration of these services is described in [Configure Kubernetes monitoring using Azure services](monitor-kubernetes-configure.md).

## Level 1 - Cluster level components

The cluster level includes the following component:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Node |  Understand the readiness status and performance of CPU, memory, disk and IP usage for each node and proactively monitor their usage trends before deploying any workloads. |

### Container Insights views and reports

- Use the **Cluster** view to see the performance of the nodes in your cluster, including CPU and memory utilization.
- Use the **Nodes** view to see the health of each node and the health and performance of the pods running on them. For more information on analyzing node health and performance, see [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container Insights](container-insights-analyze.md).
- Under **Reports**, use the **Node Monitoring** workbooks to analyze disk capacity, disk IO, and GPU usage. For more information about these workbooks, see [Node Monitoring workbooks](container-insights-reports.md#node-monitoring-workbooks).
- Under **Monitoring**, you can select **Workbooks**, then **Subnet IP Usage** to see the IP allocation and assignment on each node for a selected time-range.

### Grafana dashboards

> [!NOTE]
> Any?

### Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting scenarios, you may need to access nodes directly for maintenance or immediate log collection. For security purposes, AKS nodes aren't exposed to the internet but you can use the `kubectl debug` command to SSH to the AKS nodes. For more information on this process, see [Connect with SSH to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes for maintenance or troubleshooting](../../aks/ssh.md).

## Level 2 - Managed AKS components

The managed AKS level includes the following components:

| Component | Monitoring |
|:---|:---|
| API Server | Monitor the status of API server and identify any increase in request load and bottlenecks if the service is down. |
| Kubelet | Monitor Kubelet to help troubleshoot pod management issues, pods not starting, nodes not ready, or pods getting killed.  |

### Container Insights views and reports

- Under **Monitoring**, select **Metrics** to view the **Inflight Requests** counter.
- Under **Reports**, use the **Kubelet** workbook to see the health and performance of each kubelet. For more information about these workbooks, see [Resource Monitoring workbooks](container-insights-reports.md#resource-monitoring-workbooks). 

### Grafana dashboards

- [Kubernetes apiserver](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12006) for a complete view of the API server performance. This includes such values as request latency and workqueue processing time.


### Troubleshooting

- For troubleshooting scenarios, you can access kubelet logs using the process described at [Get kubelet logs from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes](../../aks/kubelet-logs.md).

### Resource logs

- Use [log queries with resource logs](container-insights-log-query.md#resource-logs) to analyze control plane logs generated by AKS components.

## Level 3 - Kubernetes objects and workloads

The Kubernetes objects and workloads level includes the following components:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Deployments | Monitor actual vs desired state of the deployment and the status and resource utilization of the pods running on them.  |
| Pods | Monitor status and resource utilization, including CPU and memory, of the pods running on your AKS cluster. |
| Containers | Monitor resource utilization, including CPU and memory, of the containers running on your AKS cluster. |

### Container Insights views and reports

- Use the **Nodes** and **Controllers** views to see the health and performance of the pods running on them and drill down to the health and performance of their containers.
- Use the **Containers** view to see the health and performance for the containers. For more information on analyzing container health and performance, see [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container Insights](container-insights-analyze.md#analyze-nodes-controllers-and-container-health).
- Under **Reports**, use the **Deployments** workbook to see deployment metrics. For more information, ee [Deployment & HPA metrics with Container Insights](container-insights-deployment-hpa-metrics.md).

### Grafana dashboards

> [!NOTE]
> Any?

 
### Live data

- In troubleshooting scenarios, Container Insights provides access to live AKS container logs (stdout/stderror), events and pod metrics. For more information about this feature, see [How to view Kubernetes logs, events, and pod metrics in real-time](container-insights-livedata-overview.md).

## Level 4 - Applications

The application level includes the following component:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Applications | Monitor microservice application deployments to identify application failures and latency issues, including information like request rates, response times, and exceptions. |

[Application Insights](../app/app-insights-overview.md) has multiple views for tracking the health and performance of your application. See its documentation for details on different application monitoring scenarios.



## Level 5 - External components

The components external to AKS include the following:

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Service Mesh, Ingress, Egress | Metrics based on component. |
| Database and work queues | Metrics based on component. |

Monitor external components such as Service Mesh, Ingress, Egress with Prometheus and Grafana, or other proprietary tools. Monitor databases and other Azure resources using other features of Azure Monitor. See the documentation for each services for its monitoring requirements and Azure Monitor features available for it.


## Analyze log data with Log Analytics

Select **Logs** to use the Log Analytics tool to analyze resource logs or dig deeper into data used to create the views in Container Insights. Log Analytics allows you to perform custom analysis of your log data.

For more information on Log Analytics and to get started with it, see:

- [How to query logs from Container Insights](container-insights-log-query.md)
- [Using queries in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../logs/queries.md)
- [Monitoring AKS data reference logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables)
- [Log Analytics tutorial](../logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md)

You can also use log queries to analyze resource logs from AKS. For a list of the log categories available, see [AKS data reference resource logs](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#resource-logs). You must create a diagnostic setting to collect each category as described in [Collect control plane logs for AKS clusters](monitor-kubernetes-configure.md#collect-control-plane-logs-for-aks-clusters) before the data can be collected.

## Analyze metric data with the Metrics explorer

Use the **Metrics** explorer to perform custom analysis of metric data collected for your containers. It allows you plot charts, visually correlate trends, and investigate spikes and dips in your metrics values. You can create metrics alert to proactively notify you when a metric value crosses a threshold and pin charts to dashboards for use by different members of your organization.

For more information, see [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](..//essentials/metrics-getting-started.md). For a list of the platform metrics collected for AKS, see [Monitoring AKS data reference metrics](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics). When Container Insights is enabled for a cluster, [addition metric values](container-insights-update-metrics.md) are available.

## Alerts

[Alerts in Azure Monitor](..//alerts/alerts-overview.md) proactively notify you of interesting data and patterns in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. 

Start with a set of recommended Prometheus alerts from [Metric alert rules in Container insights (preview)](container-insights-metric-alerts.md#prometheus-alert-rules) which include the most common alerting conditions for a Kubernetes cluster. 


The following table describes the different types of custom alert rules that you can create based on the data collected by the services described in [Configure Kubernetes monitoring using Azure services](monitor-kubernetes-configure.md)

| Alert type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Prometheus alerts | [Prometheus alerts](../alerts/prometheus-alerts.md) are written in Prometheus Query Language (Prom QL) and applied on Prometheus metrics stored in [Azure Monitor managed services for Prometheus](../essentials/prometheus-metrics-overview.md). Recommended alerts already include the most common Prometheus alerts, but you can [create addition alert rules](../essentials/prometheus-rule-groups.md) as required. |
| Metric alert rules | Metric alert rules use the same metric values as the Metrics explorer. In fact, you can create an alert rule directly from the metrics explorer with the data you're currently analyzing. Metric alert rules can be useful to alert on AKS performance using any of the values in [AKS data reference metrics](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics). |
| Log alert rules | Use log alert rules to generate an alert from the results of a log query. For more information, see [How to create log alerts from Container Insights](container-insights-log-alerts.md) and [How to query logs from Container Insights](container-insights-log-query.md). |
