# Monitoring Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Analyze data
This article is part of the Monitoring AKS in Azure Monitor scenario. Once youâ€™ve enabled Container insights on your AKS clusters, data will be available for analysis. This article describes the different features of Azure Monitor that allow you to analyze the health and performance of your AKS clusters. It's broken down into the layers described in [Layers of monitoring](monitor-aks.md#lasyers-of-monitoring).

## Menu options

Access Azure Monitor features for all AKS clusters in your subscription from the **Monitor** menu in the Azure portal or for a single AKS cluster from the **Monitor** section of the **Kubernetes services** menu. The screenshot below shows the cluster's **Monitor** menu.

| Menu option | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Insights | Opens container insights for the current cluster. Select **Containers** from the **Monitor** menu to open container insights for all clusters.  |
| Alerts | Views alerts for the current cluster. |
| Metrics | Open metrics explorer with the scope set to the current cluster. |
| Diagnostic settings | Create diagnostic settings for the cluster to collect resource logs. |
| Advisor | recommendations	Recommendations for the current virtual machine from Azure Advisor. |
| Logs | Open Log Analytics with the scope set to the current cluster to analyze log data. |
| Workbooks | Open workbook gallery for Kubernetes service. |

## Container insights
You will typically start with [Container insights](container-insights-overview.md) for analyzing the health and performance of the different components of your AKS cluster. Container insights provides interactive views and workbooks that analyze collected data for a variety of monitoring scenarios. You don't need to know anything about the underlying data to use Container insights.

## Analyze metric data with metrics explorer
Use metrics explorer when you want to perform custom analysis of metric data collected for your containers. Metrics explorer allows you plot charts, visually correlate trends, and investigate spikes and dips in metrics' values. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) for details on using this tool. 

For a list of the platform metrics collected for AKS, see [Monitoring AKS data reference metrics](../../aks/monitor-aks-reference.md#metrics).

## Analyze log data with Log Analytics
Use Log Analytics when you want to dig deeper into the data used to create the views in Container insights. Log Analytics allows you to perform custom analysis of your log data. You don't necessarily need to understand how to write a log query to use Log Analytics. There are multiple prebuilt queries that you can select and either run without modification or use as a start to a custom query. Click **Queries** at the top of the Log Analytics screen and view queries with a **Resource type** of **Kubernetes Services**. 

See []

See [Using queries in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../logs/queries.md) for information on using these queries and [Log Analytics tutorial](../logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md) for a complete tutorial on using Log Analytics to run queries and work with their results.

## Level 1 - Cluster level components
The first step in analyzing the health and performance of your AKS cluster is understanding the health and performance of virtual machine scale set (VMSS) that it's running on. Before deploying any pods or workloads, you should analyze this critical information.


| Component | Monitoring | Details |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Node |  Understand the readiness status and performance of CPU, memory, and disk for each node and proactively monitor their usage trends before deploying any workloads. |


Use existing views and reports in Container Insights to monitor cluster level components. The **Cluster** view gives you a quick view of the performance of the nodes in your cluster including their CPU and memory utilization. Use the **Nodes** view to view the health of each node in addition to the health and performance of the pods running on each. See [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container insights](container-insights-analyze.md) for details on using this view and analyzing node health and performance.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-cluster-view.png" alt-text="Container insights cluster view" lightbox="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-cluster-view.png":::

Use Node workbooks provided by Container Insights to analyze disk capacity and IO in addition to GPU usage. See [Node workbooks](container-insights-reports.md#node-workbooks) for a description of these workbooks.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-node-workbooks.png" alt-text="Container insights node workbooks" lightbox="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-node-workbooks.png":::

## Node logs
For troubleshooting scenarios, you may need to access the AKS nodes directly for maintenance or immediate log collection. For security purposes, the AKS nodes aren't exposed to the internet but you can `kubectl debug` to SSH to the AKS nodes. See [Connect with SSH to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes for maintenance or troubleshooting](../../aks/ssh.md) for details on this process.

## Level 2 - Managed AKS components
Control plane components including the API servers, cloud control, and kubelet. 

| Component | Monitoring |
|:---|:---|
| API Server | Monitor the status of API server, identifying any increase in request load and bottlenecks if the service is down. |
| Kubelet | Monitoring Kubelet helps in troubleshooting of pod management issues, pods not starting, nodes not ready or pods getting killed.  |

Azure Monitor and container insights don't yet provide full monitoring for the API server. You can use metrics explorer to view the **Inflight Requests** counter, but you should refer to metrics in Prometheus for a complete view of API Server performance. This includes such values as request latency and workqueue processing time. A Grafana dashboard that provides views of the critical metrics for the API server is available at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/12006).

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-aks/grafana-api-server.png" alt-text="Container insights cluster view" lightbox="media/monitor-aks/grafana-api-server.png":::

Use the Kubelet workbook to view the health and performance of each kubelet. See [Resource Monitoring workbooks](container-insights-reports.md#resource-monitoring-workbooks) for details on this workbooks. For troubleshooting scenarios, you can access kubelet logs using the process described at [Get kubelet logs from Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster nodes](../../aks/kubelet-logs.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-kubelet-workbook.png" alt-text="Container insights kubelet workbook" lightbox="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-kubelet-workbook.png":::


## Level 3 - Kubernetes objects and workloads
This level includes Kubernetes objects such as containers and deployments and the workloads running on them.

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Deployments | Monitor actual vs desired state of the deployment and the status and resource utilization of the pods running on them.  | 
| Pods | Monitor status and resource utilization, including CPU and memory, of the pods running on your AKS cluster. |
| Containers | Monitor the resource utilization, including CPU and memory, of the containers running on your AKS cluster. |


Use existing views and reports in Container Insights to monitor containers and pods. Use the **Nodes** and **Controllers** views to view the health and performance of the pods running on them and drill down to the health and performance of their containers. View the health and performance for containers directly from the **Containers** view. See [Monitor your Kubernetes cluster performance with Container insights](container-insights-analyze.md) for details on using this view and analyzing container health and performance.

:::image type="content" source="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-containers-view.png" alt-text="Container insights containers view" lightbox="media/monitor-aks/container-insights-containers-view.png":::


Container insights collects metrics for deployments that you can view with the **Deployments** workbook. See [Deployment & HPA metrics with Container insights](container-insights-deployment-hpa-metrics.md) for details.

> [!NOTE]
> Deployments view is currently in public preview.

### Live data
In troubleshooting scenarios, Container insights provides access to live AKS container logs (stdout/stderror), events, and pod metrics. See [How to view Kubernetes logs, events, and pod metrics in real-time](container-insights-livedata-overview.md) for details on using this feature.

## Level 4- Applications
This level includes the application workloads running in the AKS cluster.

| Component | Monitoring requirements |
|:---|:---|
| Applications | Monitor microservice application deployments to identify application failures and latency issues. Includes such information as request rates, response times, and exceptions. |

Application Insights provides complete monitoring of applications running on AKS and other environments. If you have a Java application, you can provide monitoring without instrumenting your code following [Zero instrumentation application monitoring for Kubernetes - Azure Monitor Application Insights](../app/kubernetes-codeless.md). For complete monitoring though, you should configure code-based monitoring depending on your application.
