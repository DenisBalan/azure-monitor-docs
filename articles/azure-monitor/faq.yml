title: Azure Monitor Frequently Asked Questions
summary: |
  This Microsoft FAQ is a list of commonly asked questions about Azure Monitor.
  

sections:
  - name: Monitoring data
    questions:
      - question: |
          Where does Azure Monitor get its data?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor collects data from various sources. These sources include logs and metrics from the Azure platform and resources, custom applications, and agents running on virtual machines. Other services such as Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Network Watcher collect data into a Log Analytics workspace so that it can be analyzed with Azure Monitor data. You can also send custom data to Azure Monitor by using the REST API for logs or metrics. See [Sources of monitoring data for Azure Monitor](data-sources.md).
          
      - question: |
          What data does Azure Monitor collect?
        answer: |
          Azure Monitor collects data from various sources into [logs](logs/data-platform-logs.md) or [metrics](essentials/data-platform-metrics.md). Each type of data has its own relative advantages, and each supports a particular set of features in Azure Monitor. There's a single metrics database for each Azure subscription, and you can create multiple Log Analytics workspaces to collect logs depending on your requirements. See [Azure Monitor data platform](data-platform.md).
          
      - question: |
          Is there a maximum amount of data that I can collect in Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          There's no limit to the amount of metric data you can collect, but this data is stored for a maximum of 93 days. See [Retention of metrics](essentials/data-platform-metrics.md#retention-of-metrics). There's no limit on the amount of log data that you can collect, but the pricing tier you choose for the Log Analytics workspace might affect the limit. See [Pricing details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).
          
      - question: |
          How do I access data collected by Azure Monitor?
        answer: |
          Insights and solutions provide a custom experience for working with data stored in Azure Monitor. You can work directly with log data by using a log query written in Kusto Query Language (KQL). In the Azure portal, you can write and run queries and interactively analyze data by using Log Analytics. Analyze metrics in the Azure portal with the metrics explorer. See [Analyze log data in Azure Monitor](logs/log-query-overview.md) and [Analyze metrics with Azure Monitor metrics explorer](essentials/analyze-metrics.md).
          
      - question: |
          Why am I seeing duplicate records in Azure Monitor Logs?
        answer: |
          Occasionally, you might notice duplicate records in Azure Monitor Logs. This duplication is typically from one of the following two conditions:
          
          - Components in the pipeline have retries to ensure reliable delivery at the destination. Occasionally, this capability might result in duplicates for a small percentage of telemetry items.
          - If the duplicate records come from a virtual machine, you might have both the Log Analytics agent and Azure Monitor Agent installed. If you still need the Log Analytics agent installed, configure the Log Analytics workspace to no longer collect data that's also being collected by the data collection rule used by Azure Monitor Agent.
  
  - name: Prometheus
    questions:
      - question: |
          What's an Azure Monitor workspace? 
        answer: |
          Prometheus metrics collected by managed service for Prometheus are stored in an Azure Monitor workspace. It's essentially a container where Prometheus metrics from various sources are stored. You might have a single Azure Monitor workspace for all of your Prometheus metrics or you might have requirements for multiple workspaces. See [Azure Monitor workspace overview](essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md?#azure-monitor-workspace-architecture).  
      - question: |
          What's the difference between an Azure Monitor workspace and a Log Analytics workspace?
        answer: |
          An Azure Monitor workspace is a unique environment for data collected by Azure Monitor. Each workspace has its own data repository, configuration, and permissions. Azure Monitor workspaces will eventually contain all metrics collected by Azure Monitor, including native metrics. Currently, the only data hosted by an Azure Monitor workspace is Prometheus metrics. See [Azure Monitor workspace overview](essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). 
      - question: |
          How do I retrieve Prometheus metrics? 
        answer: |
          All data is retrieved from an Azure Monitor workspace by using queries that are written in Prometheus Query Language (PromQL). You can write your own queries, use queries from the open source community, and use Grafana dashboards that include PromQL queries. See the [Prometheus project](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/). 
      - question: |
          Can I delete Prometheus metrics from an Azure Monitor workspace?
        answer: |
          Data is removed from the Azure Monitor workspace according to its data retention period, which is 18 months. 
      - question: |
          Can I view my Prometheus metrics in Azure Monitor metrics explorer? 
        answer: |
          Metrics explorer in Azure Monitor doesn't currently support visualizing Prometheus metric data. Consider using [Azure Managed Grafana](../managed-grafana/index.yml) to visualize your Prometheus metrics. 
      - question: |
          Can I use Azure Managed Grafana in a different region than my Azure Monitor workspace and managed service for Prometheus?
        answer: |
          Yes. When you use managed service for Prometheus, you can create your Azure Monitor workspace in any of the supported regions. Your Azure Kubernetes Service clusters can be in any region and send data into an Azure Monitor workspace in a different region. Azure Managed Grafana can also be in a different region than where you created your Azure Monitor workspace. 
      - question: |
          When I use managed service for Prometheus, can I store data for more than one cluster in an Azure Monitor workspace?
        answer: |
          Yes. Managed service for Prometheus is intended to enable scenarios where you can store data from several Azure Kubernetes Service clusters in a single Azure Monitor workspace. See [Azure Monitor workspace overview](essentials/azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md?#azure-monitor-workspace-architecture).  
      - question: |
          What types of resources can send Prometheus metrics to managed service for Prometheus?
        answer: |
          Our agent can be used on Azure Kubernetes Service clusters and Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters. It's installed as a managed add-on for AKS clusters and an extension for Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters and you can configure it to collect the data you want. You can also configure remote write on Kubernetes clusters running in Azure, another cloud, or on-premises by following our instructions for enabling remote write.

          If you use the Azure portal to enable Prometheus metrics collection and install the AKS add-on or Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes extension from the Insights page of your cluster, it enables logs collection into Log Analytics and Prometheus metrics collection into managed service for Prometheus.
      - question: |
          Does enabling managed service for Prometheus on my Azure Kubernetes Service cluster also enable Container insights?
        answer: |
          You have options for how you can collect your Prometheus metrics. If you use the Azure portal and enable Prometheus metrics collection and install the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) add-on from the Azure Monitor workspace UX, it won't enable Container insights and collection of log data. When you go to the Insights page on your AKS cluster, you're prompted to enable Container insights to collect log data.<br>
          
          If you use the Azure portal and enable Prometheus metrics collection and install the AKS add-on from the Insights page of your AKS cluster, it enables log collection into a Log Analytics workspace. and Prometheus metrics collection into an Azure Monitor workspace. 
      - question: |
          I am missing all or some of my metrics. How can I troubleshoot?
        answer: |
          You can use the troubleshooting guide for ingesting Prometheus metrics from the managed agent [here](essentials/prometheus-metrics-troubleshoot.md).
      - question: |
          Why am I missing metrics that have two labels with the same name but different casing?
        answer: |
          Metrics that have two label names that are the same except for their casing will be treated as having duplicate label names. These time series will be dropped upon ingestion since the two labels are seen as the same. For example, the time series `my_metric{ExampleLabel="label_value_0", examplelabel="label_value_1}` will be dropped due to duplicate labels since `ExampleLabel` and `examplelabel` will be seen as the same label name.
      - question: |
           I see some gaps in metric data, why is this occurring?   
        answer: |
           During node updates you might see a 1 to 2 minute gap in metric data for metrics collected from our cluster level collectors because the node that it runs on is being updated as part of a normal update process. This affects cluster-wide targets such as kube-state-metrics and custom application targets that are specified. This occurs when your cluster is updated manually or via auto-update. This is expected behavior that occurs due to the node it runs on being updated. None of our recommended alert rules are affected by this behavior. 
           
  - name: Container insights
  
    questions:
         
                        
      - question: |
          Is there support for collecting Kubernetes audit logs for ARO clusters?
        answer:
          No. Container insights don't support collection of Kubernetes audit logs.

      - question: |
          Why don't I see Normal event types when I query the KubeEvents table?
        answer:
          By default, Normal event types aren't collected unless the *collect_all_kube_events* ConfigMap setting is enabled. If you need to collect Normal events, enable *collect_all_kube_events setting* in the *container-azm-ms-agentconfig* ConfigMap. See [Configure agent data collection for Container insights](containers/container-insights-agent-config.md) for information on how to configure the ConfigMap.

      - question: |
          Does Container Insights support pod sandboxing?
        answer: |
          Yes, Container Insights supports pod sandboxing through support for Kata Containers. For more details on pod sandboxing in AKS, [refer to the AKS docs](/azure/aks/use-pod-sandboxing).

          What operating systems for the monitoring virtual machine are supported?
        answer: |
          Ubuntu 18.04 is currently the only operating system supported for the monitoring virtual machine.

      - question: |
          Where is the monitoring data stored in Log Analytics?
        answer: |
          All the monitoring data is stored in the `InsightsMetrics` table. The `Origin` column has the value `solutions.azm.ms/telegraf/SqlInsights`. The `Namespace` column has values that start with `sqlserver_`.

      - question: |
          How often is data collected?
        answer: |
          The frequency of data collection is customizable. See [Data collected by SQL Insights (preview)](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-insights-overview#collected-data) for information on the default frequencies. See [Create SQL monitoring profile](/azure/azure-sql/database/sql-insights-enable#create-sql-monitoring-profile) for instructions on customizing frequencies.
