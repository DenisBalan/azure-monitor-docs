# Common alert schema

The common alert schema standardizes the consumption experience for alert notifications in Azure. Historically, activity log, metric, and log alerts each had their own email templates and webhook schemas. The common alert schema provides one standardized consistent consistent schema for all alert notifications. 

A standardized schema can help you minimize the number of integrations, which makes the process of managing and maintaining them a much simpler task. Future alert payload enrichments like customization and diagnostic enrichment will only surface in the common schema.

The new schema also enables a richer alert consumption experience across both the Azure portal and the Azure mobile app.

> [!NOTE]
> Alerts generated by [VM insights](../vm/vminsights-overview.md) currently don't support the common schema.

All alert instances include information about the affected resource and the cause of the alert in these sections:
- **Essentials**: Standardized fields, common across all alert types, describe what resource the alert is on along with other common alert metadata. Examples include severity or description. For example, if you want to route alert instances to specific teams based on criteria such as a resource group, you can use the essential fields to provide standardized routing logic for all alert types. The field teams can then use the context fields for their investigation.
- **Alert context**: These fields describe the cause of the alert, with fields that vary based on the alert type. For example, a metric alert would have fields like the metric name and metric value in the alert context. An activity log alert would have information about the event that generated the alert.

## What enhancements does the common alert schema bring?

You'll see the benefits of using a common alert schema in your alert notifications. A common alert schema provides these benefits:

| Action | Enhancements|
|:---|:---|
| Email | A consistent and detailed email template. You can use it to easily diagnose issues at a glance. Embedded deep links to the alert instance on the portal and the affected resource ensure that you can quickly jump into the remediation process. |
| Webhook/Azure Logic Apps/Azure Functions/Azure Automation runbook | A consistent JSON structure for all alert types. You can use it to easily build integrations across the different alert types. |

## How do I enable the common alert schema?

Use action groups in the Azure portal or use the REST API to enable the common alert schema. You can enable a new schema at the action level. For example, you must separately opt in for an email action and a webhook action.

> [!NOTE]
> Smart detection alerts support the common schema by default. No opt-in is required.

### Through the Azure portal

![Screenshot that shows the common alert schema opt in.](media/alerts-common-schema/portal-opt-in.png)

1. Open any existing action or a new action in an action group.
1. Select **Yes** to enable the common alert schema.

### Through the Action Groups REST API

You can also use the [Action Groups API](/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups) to opt in to the common alert schema. While you make the [create or update](/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups/createorupdate) REST API call, you can set the flag "useCommonAlertSchema" to `true` to opt in or `false` to opt out for email, webhook, Logic Apps, Azure Functions, or Automation runbook actions.

For example, the following request body made to the [create or update](/rest/api/monitor/actiongroups/createorupdate) REST API will:

- Enable the common alert schema for the email action "John Doe's email."
- Disable the common alert schema for the email action "Jane Smith's email."
- Enable the common alert schema for the webhook action "Sample webhook."
