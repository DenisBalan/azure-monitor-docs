# Profile live Azure App Service apps with Application Insights

Profiler currently works for ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core apps that are running on Azure App Service. The Basic service tier or higher is required to use Profiler. Enabling Profiler on Linux is currently only possible via [this method](profiler-aspnetcore-linux.md).

## <a id="installation"></a> Enable Profiler for your app
To enable Profiler for an app, follow the instructions below. If you are running a different type of Azure service, here are instructions for enabling Profiler on other supported platforms:
* [Cloud Services](../../azure-monitor/app/profiler-cloudservice.md?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json)
* [Service Fabric Applications](../../azure-monitor/app/profiler-servicefabric.md?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json)
* [Virtual Machines](../../azure-monitor/app/profiler-vm.md?toc=/azure/azure-monitor/toc.json)

Application Insights Profiler is pre-installed as part of the App Services runtime, but you need to turn it on to get profiles for your App Service app. Once you have deployed an app, even if you have included the App Insights SDK in the source code, follow the steps below to enable the profiler.

1. Enable "Always On" setting for you app service. You can update this in the Configuration page of your App Service under General Settings.
1. Go to the **App Services** pane in the Azure portal.
1. Navigate to **Settings > Application Insights** pane.

3. Either follow the instructions on the pane to create a new resource or select an existing App Insights resource to monitor your app. Also make sure the Profiler is **On**. If your Application Insights resource is in a different subscription from your App Service, you can't use this page to configure Application Insights. You can still do it manually though by creating necessary app settings manually. [Please refer to the next section for instructions.](../../azure-monitor/app/profiler.md#Enable-Profiler-manually-or-with-Azure-Resource-Manager)

4. Profiler is now enabled using an App Services App Setting.

## Enable Profiler manually or with Azure Resource Manager
Application Insights Profiler can be enabled by creating app settings for your Azure App Service. The page with the options shown above creates these app settings for you, but if you want to automate this using a template or other means, you can create the settings yourself. This will also work if your Application Insights resource is in a different subscription from your Azure App Service.
Here are the settings needed to enable the profiler:
|App Setting    | Value    |
|---------------|----------|
|APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY         | iKey for you Application Insights resource    |
|APPINSIGHTS_PROFILERFEATURE_VERSION | 1.0.0 |
|DiagnosticServices_EXTENSION_VERSION | ~3 |

You can set these values using [Azure Resource Manager Templates](../../azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps#app-service-application-settings-with-azure-resource-manager), [Azure Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.websites/set-azwebapp),  [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/webapp/config/appsettings?view=azure-cli-latest).


## Disable Profiler

To stop or restart Profiler for an individual app's instance, under **Web Jobs**, go to the app resource. To delete Profiler, go to **Extensions**.

![Disable Profiler for a web job][disable-profiler-webjob]

We recommend that you have Profiler enabled on all your apps to discover any performance issues as early as possible.

If you use WebDeploy to deploy changes to your web application, make sure you exclude the App_Data folder from being deleted during deployment. Otherwise, the Profiler extension's files are deleted the next time you deploy the web application to Azure.
