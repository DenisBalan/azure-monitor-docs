# Application Monitor

ApplicationMonitor is a PowerShell Module published to the [PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.ApplicationMonitor) 
and is the replacement for [Status Monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/monitor-performance-live-website-now). 
This module provides code-less instrumentation of .NET web applications hosted on-prem. 
Telemetry will be sent to the Azure portal where you can [monitor](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) your application.

> [!CAUTION] 
> This module is a prototype application, and isn't recommended for your production environments.

## FAQ

- Does ApplicationMonitor support proxy installations?

  **Yes**. You have multiple options to download the ApplicationMonitor. 
If your computer has internet access, you can onboard to the PowerShell Gallery using `-Proxy` parameters. 
You can also manually download this module and either install it on your machine or use the module directly. 
Each of these options is described in our [Detailed Instructions](iis-configurator-detailed-instructions.md).
  
- How to verify the enablement was successful?

   We don't have a cmdlet to verify that enablement was successful. 
We recommend using [Live Metrics](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream) to quickly observe if your application is sending us telemetry.
