# Configure BYOS (Bring Your Own Storage) for Profiler & Snapshot Debugger

## What is Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) and why I need it? 
In normal process when a customer's application doesn't have configured the capability of Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS), the data its written into the regional storage accounts of Diagnostic Services that compliant with multiple laws according to the location, one of them is General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

With Bring Your Own Storage, the data collected, by agents running in the customer's VMs or App Service, its written into their own storage accounts, giving them the capability to control the data collected at their own peace. One thing to have in mind is that the customer will take over of all the related costs of the storage account. 

## How does it will be accessed my Storage Account? 
The data its written into the customer's storage account by agents running in the customer's VMs (virtual machines) or App Service. The customer's application contacts our service (Profiler/Debugger) when they want to upload data and we hand back a SAS (Shared Access Signature) token to a blob in their storage account. Later, when they want to analyze the data, the profiler/debugger service will reach back into that storage account to read the blob and write back the results of the analysis.

## What do I need to do to enable BYOS? 
Since our services need to securely connect to your storage account, the profiler/debugger service has a 1st party (multi-tenant) AAD (Azure Active Directory) application called "Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access" that it's used to access customer storage accounts. The customer needs to grant the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role to that AAD application in their storage account via the Access control (IAM) UI, as shown in Figure 1.0. 

Steps: 
1. Click on the "Add" button in the "Add a role assignment" section 
2. Select "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role 
3. Select "Azure AD user, group, or service principal" in the "Assign access to" section 
4. Search & select "Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access" app 
5. Save changes

After you added the role, it will appear under the "Role assignments" section, like the below Figure 1.1.

If you are also using Private Link, it is required one additional configuration to allow connection to our Trusted Microsoft Service from your Virtual Network. Please refer to the [Storage Network Security documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security#trusted-microsoft-services).

## Prerequisites
* Make sure to create your Storage Account in the same location as your Application Insights Resource. Ex. If your Application Insights resource is in West US 2, your Storage Account must be also in West US 2. 
* Grant the "Storage Blob Contributor" role to the AAD (Azure Active Directory) application "Diagnostic Services Trusted Storage Access" in your storage account via the IAM UI.
* If Private Link enabled, configure the additional setting to allow connection to our Trusted Microsoft Service from your Virtual Network. 

## Enablement process 
1. You have two options to configure BYOS for code-level diagnostics (Profiler/Debugger):

    a. Using the following CLI (Not implemented yet, to be defined).
    ```powershell
    az monitor log-analytics {workspace} serviceprofiler {storage-account-id} create | update
    ```
    b. Using the ARM (Azure Resource Manager) template.
    * Create an ARM template file with the following content (byos.template.json).
    ```json
    {
      "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "applicationinsights_name": {
          "type": "String"
        },
        "applicationinsights_location": {
          "type": "String"
        },
        "storageaccount_name": {
          "type": "String"
        }
      },
      "variables": {},
      "resources": [
        {
          "type": "microsoft.insights/components",
          "apiVersion": "2015-05-01",
          "location": "[parameters('applicationinsights_location')]",
          "name": "[parameters('applicationinsights_name')]",
          "properties": {},
          "resources": [
            {
              "type": "linkedStorageAccounts",
              "name": "serviceprofiler",
              "apiVersion": "2020-03-01-preview",
              "properties": {
                "linkedStorageAccount": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts', parameters('storageaccount_name'))]"
              },
              "dependsOn": [
                "[concat('Microsoft.Insights/components/', parameters('applicationinsights_name'))]"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ],
      "outputs": {}
    }
    ```
    * Run the following powershell command to deploy previous ARM template (create Linked Storage Account).
    ```powershell
    # Command pattern
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "{your_resource_name}" -TemplateFile "{local_path_to_arm_template}"
    
    # Command example
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName "byos-test" -TemplateFile "D:\Docs\byos.template.json"
    ```
    * Provide the following parameters when prompted in the Powershell console:
    
    |           Parameter           |                                Description                               |
    |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | application_insights_name     | The name of the Application Insights resource to enable BYOS.            |
    | application_insights_location | The location of your Application Insights resource (ex. westus2).        |
    | storage_account_name          | The name of the Storage Account resource that you will use as your BYOS. |
    
    Expected output:
    ```powershell
    Supply values for the following parameters:
    (Type !? for Help.)
    application_insights_name: byos-test-westus2-ai
    application_insights_location: westus2

    Outputs                 :

    ```

2. Enable code-level diagnostics (Profiler/Debugger) on the workload of interest through the Azure Portal. (App Service > Application Insights)

## Troubleshooting
### No registered resource provider found for location '{location}'.
* Make sure that the `$schema` property of the ARM template it's valid. It must follow the following pattern:
`https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/{schema_version}/deploymentTemplate.json#`
* Make sure that the `apiVersion` of the resource `microsoft.insights/components` it's `2015-05-01`.
* Make sure that the `apiVersion` of the resource `linkedStorageAccount` its `2020-03-01-preview`.
    Error message:
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment : 6:18:03 PM - Resource microsoft.insights/components 'byos-test-westus2-ai' failed with message '{
      "error": {
        "code": "NoRegisteredProviderFound",
        "message": "No registered resource provider found for location 'westus2' and API version '2020-03-01-preview' for type 'components'. The supported api-versions are '2014-04-01,

    australiasoutheast'."
      }
    }'
    ```
### Storage account location should match AI component location.
* Make sure that the location of the Application Insights resource it's the same as the Storage Account trying to use. 
    Error message:
    ```powershell
    New-AzResourceGroupDeployment : 1:01:12 PM - Resource microsoft.insights/components/linkedStorageAccounts 'byos-test-centralus-ai/serviceprofiler' failed with message '{
      "error": {
        "code": "BadRequest",
        "message": "Storage account location should match AI component location",
        "innererror": {
          "trace": [
            "System.ArgumentException"
          ]
        }
      }
    }'

    _Yes, to be precise, BYOS is a requisite to have profiler/debugger enabled with CMK (Customer Manager Keys)._

* Will BYOS work when Private Link was enabled? 
    _Yes, to be precise, BYOS is a requisite to have profiler/debugger enabled with PL (Private Link)._

* Will BYOS work when, both, CMK and PL were enabled? 
    _Yes, it can be possible._

* If I have enabled BYOS, can I go back using Diagnostic Services storage accounts to store my data collected? 
    _Yes, you can, but keep in mind that, as of now, we do not support data migration from your BYOS._

* After enabling BYOS, will I take over of all the related costs of it? 
    _Yes_
