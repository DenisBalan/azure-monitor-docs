# How to configure the Azure Monitor Application Insights for Java Profiler

The Application Insights Java Profiler provides a system for:

1. Generating on demand JDK Flight Recorder (JFR) profiles from the running JVM.
2. Generating JFR profiles automatically when certain trigger conditions are met from the running JVM
   , such as CPU or memory breaching a configured threshold.

## Overview

The Application Insights Java profiler uses the JFR profiler provided by the JVM to record profiling
data. So that users may download the JFR recordings at a later time and analyze them to identify
the cause of performance issues. This data is gathered on demand when trigger conditions are met.
Currently, the available triggers are thresholds over CPU usage and Memory consumption. When a
threshold is breached, a profile of the configured type and duration is gathered and uploaded. This
profile is then visible within the performance blade of the associated Application Insights Portal
UI.

> [!WARNING]
> The JFR profiler by default executes the "profile-without-env-data" profile. This configuration is
> similar to the "profile" configuration that ships with the JVM, however has had some events disabled
> that have the potential to contain sensitive deployment information such as environment variables,
> arguments provided to the JVM and processes running on the system. The flags that have been disabled
> are:
>
> - jdk.JVMInformation
> - jdk.InitialSystemProperty
> - jdk.OSInformation
> - jdk.InitialEnvironmentVariable
> - jdk.SystemProcess
>
> However, you should review all flags enabled to ensure that profiles do not contain sensitive data.
> See (#configuring-profile-contents) on setting a custom profiler configuration.

## USAGE

### Pre-requisites

In order to profile a Java application it is required that:

- Your JVM has the Java Flight Recorder (JFR) capability.
    - `<Insert Required java versions here>`
- You are using an Application Insights Agent that has the profiling capability
    - `<Insert agent version>`

### Triggers

For more detailed description of the various triggers available
see [sampling overrides](../profiler/profiler-overview.md).

The ApplicationInsights Java Agent
monitors CPU and memory consumption and if it breaches a configured threshold a profile is triggered.
Both thresholds are a percentage. 

#### CPU
For CPU the threshold is a percentage of the usage of all available
cores on the system, for instance, if your machine has saturated 1 core of an 8 core machine the CPU
percentage would be considered 12.5%. 

#### Memory
For memory the percentage is the current Tenured memory region (OldGen) occupancy
against the maximum possible size of the region, this is evaluated after a tenured collection has been performed.
If the maximum possible size of the Tenured memory region is 1024mb (this is the size it could be if the JVMs heap grew
to its maximum size), and your threshold was set to 75%, then in order to trigger the occupancy of the Tenured region
would need to be greater than 768mb after a collection that operates on the Tenured region (such as G1 Mixed collection
or a Full GC).

### Installation

The following steps will guide you through enabling the profiling component on the agent and
configuring resource limits which will trigger a profile if breached.

1. Inside the `applicationinsights.json` configuration of your process enable the profiler by
   setting the `preview.profiler.enabled` setting:
   ```json
      {
         "connectionString" : "...",
         "preview" : {
            "profiler" : {
               "enabled" : true
            }
         }
      }
   ```
   Alternatively, set the `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_PROFILER_ENABLED` environment variable to true.
2. Restart your process with the updated configuration.
3. Configure the resource thresholds that will cause a profile to be collected:
    1. Browse to the Performance -> Profiler section of the Application Insights instance.
    2. Select "Triggers"
    3. Configure the required CPU and Memory thresholds. And select Apply.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently the Java profiler does not support the "Sampling" trigger, configuring this will have no effect.

Once this has been completed, the agent will monitor the resource usage of your process and
trigger a profile when the threshold is exceeded. Once a profile has been triggered and completed, it will be
viewable from the
Application Insights instance within the Performance -> Profiler section. From that screen the
profile can be downloaded, once download the JFR recording file can be opened and analyzed within a
tool of your choosing.

### Configuration

Configuration of the profiler triggering settings, such as thresholds and profiling periods are set
within the ApplicationInsights UI under the Performance, Profiler, Triggers UI as
described in [Installation](#installation).

Additionally, a number of parameters can be configured using environment variables and the
`applicationinsights.json` configuration file.

#### Configuring Profile Contents

If you wish to provide a custom profile configuration, alter the `memoryTriggeredSettings`
and `cpuTriggeredSettings` to provide the path to a `.jfc` file with your required configuration.
Profiles can be generated/edited in the JDK Mission Control (JMC) user
interface under the `Window->Flight Recording Template Manager` menu and control over individual
flags is found inside `Edit->Advanced` of this user interface.

### Environment variables

- `APPLICATIONINSIGHTS_PROFILER_ENABLED`: boolean (default false)
    - Enables/disables the profiling feature.

### Configuration file

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "preview": {
    "profiler": {
      "enabled": true,
      "cpuTriggeredSettings": "profile-without-env-data",
      "memoryTriggeredSettings": "profile-without-env-data"
    }
  }
}

```

`memoryTriggeredSettings` This configuration will be used in the event of a memory profile is
requested. This can be one of:

- `profile-without-env-data` (default value). A profile with certain sensitive events disabled, see
  Warning section above for details.
- `profile`. Uses the `profile.jfc` configuration that ships with JFR.
- A path to a custom jfc configuration file on the file system, i.e `/tmp/myconfig.jfc`.

`cpuTriggeredSettings` This configuration will be used in the event of a cpu profile is requested.
This can be one of:

- `profile-without-env-data` (default value). A profile with certain sensitive events disabled, see
  Warning section above for details.
- `profile`. Uses the `profile.jfc` jfc configuration that ships with JFR.
- A path to a custom jfc configuration file on the file system, i.e `/tmp/myconfig.jfc`.
