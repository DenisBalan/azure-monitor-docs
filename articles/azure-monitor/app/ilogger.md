# ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider for .NET Core ILogger logs.

ASP.NET Core supports a logging API that works with a variety of built-in and third-party logging providers. This article shows how to use ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider to capture logs logged via ILogger in both console and ASP.NET Core applications. This article also talks about how ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider is integrated with other telemetry collection (Requests, Dependencies etc.) features provided by Application Insights SDK. 
To learn more about ILogger based logging, see [this article](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging).

## ASP.NET Core applications
Starting with [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNet SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore) version 2.7.0-beta3 onwards, ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider is enabled by default when enabling regular ApplicationInsights monitoring using either of the standard methods - by calling `UseApplicationInsights` extension method on IWebHostBuilder or `AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry` extension method on IServiceCollection. ILoggers logs are sent as `TraceTelemetry` to ApplicationInsights (`ExceptionTelemetry` if an exception is passed to Log methods), and they are subject to same configuration as any other telemetry collected. i.e they will be running the same set of `TelemetryInitializers`, `TelemetryProcessors`, uses the same `TelemetryChannel` and will be correlated, sampled/not sampled in the same way as every other telemetry.  If you are on this version of SDK or higher, then no action is required to capture ILoggers logs.
 
By default, only ILogger logs of Warning level or above (from all categories) are sent to ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider. This behavior can be changed by applying Filters as shown [here](../../azure-monitor/app/ilogger.md#control-logging-level). Also additional steps are required if ILogger logs from Program.cs or Startup.cs is to be captured as shown [here](../../azure-monitor/app/ilogger.md#Capturing-ILogger-logs-from-Startup.cs,-Program.cs-in-Asp.Net-Core-Applications).


If you are using an earlier version of Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNet SDK, or you want to just use ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider, without any other ApplicationInsights monitoring, follow the steps below.

1. Install these nuget packages. 

```xml
    <ItemGroup>
      <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="2.1.0" />
      <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging" Version="2.1.0" />
      <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights" Version="2.9.1" />  
    </ItemGroup>
```

2. Modify Program.cs as below

```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build().Run();
        }

        public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .ConfigureLogging(
                    builder =>
                        {
                            // providing an instrumentation key here is required if you are using standalone package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights or if you want to 
                            // capture logs from early in the application startup pipeline from Startup.cs or Program.cs itself.                            
                            builder.AddApplicationInsights("ikey");                           

                            // Optional: Apply filters to control what logs are sent to ApplicationInsights.
                            // The following configures LogLevel Information or above to be sent to ApplicationInsights for all categories.
                            builder.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("", LogLevel.Information);
                        }
                    );
    }
```

The above code will configure ApplicationInsightsProvider. Following shows an example Controller class which uses ILogger to send logs, which are captured by ApplicationInsights.

```csharp
public class ValuesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public ValuesController(ILogger<ValuesController> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    // GET api/values
    [HttpGet]
    public ActionResult<IEnumerable<string>> Get()
    {
        // All the following logs will be picked up by Application Insights.
        // and all have ("MyKey", "MyValue") in Properties.
        using (_logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { { "MyKey", "MyValue" } }))
            {            
            _logger.LogWarning("An example of a Warning trace..");
            _logger.LogError("An example of an Error level message");
            }
        return new string[] { "value1", "value2" };
    }
}
```
### Capturing ILogger logs from Startup.cs, Program.cs in Asp.Net Core Applications
With the new ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider, it is possible to capture logs from very early in the application startup pipeline. Even though ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider is automatically enabled when enabling ApplicationInsights (from 2.7.0-beta3 onwards), it will not have instrumentation key setup until later in the pipeline, so only logs from Controller/other classes will be captured. To capture every logs starting with Program.cs and Startup.cs itself, one need to explicitly enable ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider with an instrumentation key. It is also important to note that `TelemetryConfiguration` is not fully set up when logging something from `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` itself, so those logs will use a bare minimum configuration which uses InMemoryChannel, no sampling, and no standard TelemetryInitializers.

Following shows examples of Program.cs and Startup.cs using this capability.

#### Example Program.cs

```csharp
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore;
    using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
    using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

    public class Program
    {
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var host = CreateWebHostBuilder(args).Build();                
            var logger = host.Services.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();
            // This will be picked up by AI
            logger.LogInformation("From Program. Running the host now.."); 

            host.Run();
        }

        public static IWebHostBuilder CreateWebHostBuilder(string[] args) =>
            WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .ConfigureLogging(
                    builder =>
                        {
                            // providing an instrumentation key here is required if you are using standalone package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights or if you want to 
                            // capture logs from early in the application startup pipeline from Startup.cs or Program.cs itself.                            
                            builder.AddApplicationInsights("ikey");                           
                            
                            // Adding the filter below to ensure logs of all severity from Program.cs is sent to ApplicationInsights. Replace YourAppName with the namespace of your application's Program.cs
                            builder.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("YourAppName.Program", LogLevel.Trace);
                            // Adding the filter below to ensure logs of all severity from Startup.cs is sent to ApplicationInsights. Replace YourAppName with the namespace of your application's Startup.cs
                            builder.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("YourAppName.Startup", LogLevel.Trace);
                        }
                    );
    }
```

#### Example Startup.cs
```csharp
public class Startup
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public Startup(IConfiguration configuration, ILogger<Startup> logger)
    {
        Configuration = configuration;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to add services to the container.
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry();

        // The following will be picked up by Application Insights.
        _logger.LogInformation("Logging from ConfigureServices."); 
    }

    // This method gets called by the runtime. Use this method to configure the HTTP request pipeline.
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
    {
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            // The following will be picked up by Application Insights.
            _logger.LogInformation("Configuring for Development environment");
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            // The following will be picked up by Application Insights.
            _logger.LogInformation("Configuring for Production environment");
        }

        app.UseMvc();
    }
}
```

## Migrating from old ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider
Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNet SDK versions before 2.7.0-beta2, supported a logging provider which is now obsolete. This provider was enabled with AddApplicationInsights() extension method of ILoggerFactory. This provider is now obsolete, and users are suggested to migrate to the new provider. Migration involves two steps.
1. Remove ILoggerFactory.AddApplicationInsights() call from Startup.Configure method to avoid double logging.
2. Re-apply any filtering rules in code as they will not be respected by the new provider. Overloads of ILoggerFactory.AddApplicationInsights() took minimum LogLevel or filter functions. With the new provider, filtering is part of the logging framework itself, and not done by ApplicationInsights provider. So any filter functions provided should be removed, and filtering should be done outside of Application Insights. If you were using appsettings.json to filter logging, then these will continue to work with new provider as both uses same Provider Alias - **ApplicationInsights**. Please see [this](../../azure-monitor/app/ilogger.md#control-logging-level) section for details on how to do filtering.

While old provider can still be used (its obsolete now and will be removed only in major version change to 3.xx), migrating to newer provider is highly recommended due to following reasons.
  1. Previous provider did not support [scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-2.2#log-scopes). In the new provider, properties from scope are automatically added as custom properties to the collected telemetry.
  2. Logs can now be captured much earlier in the application startup pipeline. i.e Logs from Program and Startup classes can now be captured.
  3. With new provider, the filtering is done at the framework level itself. Filtering of logs to ApplicationInsights provider can be done in exact same way as for other providers, including built-in providers like Console, Debug etc. It is also possible to apply same filters to multiple providers.
  4. The [recommended](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/255) way in Asp.Net Core (2.0 onwards) to enable logging providers is by using extension methods on ILoggingBuilder in `Program.cs` itself.

> [!Note]
The new Provider is available for applications targeting NETSTANDARD2.0 or higher. If your application is targeting older framework like .NET Core 1.1, continue to use the old provider.

## Console application

The following shows a sample Console application configured to send ILogger traces to Application Insights.

Packages installed:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection" Version="2.1.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging" Version="2.1.0" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights" Version="2.9.1" />
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console" Version="2.1.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create DI container.
        IServiceCollection services = new ServiceCollection();

        // Channel is explicitly configured to do flush on it later.
        var channel = new InMemoryChannel();
        services.Configure<TelemetryConfiguration>(
            (config) =>
            {
                config.TelemetryChannel = channel;
            }
        );

        // Add the logging pipelines to use. We are using Application Insights only here.
        services.AddLogging(loggingBuilder =>
        {
            // Optional: Apply filters to configure LogLevel Trace or above is sent to ApplicationInsights for all
            // categories.
            loggingBuilder.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("", LogLevel.Trace);
            loggingBuilder.AddApplicationInsights("--YourAIKeyHere--");                
        });

        // Build ServiceProvider.
        IServiceProvider serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();

        ILogger<Program> logger = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<Program>>();

        // Begin a new scope. This is optional. Epecially in case of AspNetCore request info is already
        // present in scope.
        using (logger.BeginScope(new Dictionary<string, object> { { "Method", nameof(Main) } }))
        {
            logger.LogInformation("Logger is working"); // this will be captured by Application Insights.
        }

        // Explicitly call Flush() followed by sleep is required in Console Apps.
        // This is to ensure that even if application terminates, telemetry is sent to the back-end.
        channel.Flush();
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
}
```

In the above example, the standalone package Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights is used. By default, this configuration uses the bare minimum `TelemetryConfiguration` for sending data to
Application Insights. Bare minimum means the channel used will be `InMemoryChannel`, no sampling, and no standard TelemetryInitializers. This behavior can be overridden for a console application
as shown in example below.

Install this additional package:

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel" Version="2.9.1" />
```

The following section shows how to override the default `TelemetryConfiguration` by using services.Configure<TelemetryConfiguration>() method as shown in the following example. This example sets up `ServerTelemetryChannel`, sampling, and adds a custom `ITelemetryInitializer` to the `TelemetryConfiguration`.

```csharp
    // Create DI container.
    IServiceCollection services = new ServiceCollection();
    var serverChannel = new ServerTelemetryChannel();
    services.Configure<TelemetryConfiguration>(
        (config) =>
        {
            config.TelemetryChannel = serverChannel;
            config.TelemetryInitializers.Add(new MyTelemetryInitalizer());
            config.DefaultTelemetrySink.TelemetryProcessorChainBuilder.UseSampling(5);
            serverChannel.Initialize(config);
        }
    );

    // Add the logging pipelines to use. We are adding ApplicationInsights only.
    services.AddLogging(loggingBuilder =>
    {
        loggingBuilder.AddApplicationInsights();
    });

    ........
    ........

    // Explicitly call Flush() followed by sleep is required in Console Apps.
    // This is to ensure that even if application terminates, telemetry is sent to the back-end.
    serverChannel.Flush();
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
```


# Control logging level

The Asp.Net Core ILogger infra has built-in mechanism to apply [filtering](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-2.2#log-filtering) of logs, which allows users to control the logs sent to each registered providers, including ApplicationInsights provider. This can be done either in configuration(typically using appsettings.json file) or in code. This facility is provided by the framework itself, and is not specific to Application Insights provider.

Examples of applying the filter rules to ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider is given below.

## Filtering Using Configuration in appsettings.json

For ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider, the provider alias is `ApplicationInsights`. The below shown section in appsettings.json configures `ApplicationInsights` to capture only logs of `Warning` and above from all categories, `Error` and above from categories starting with 'Microsoft'.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "ApplicationInsights": {
      "LogLevel": {
        "Default": "Warning",
        "Microsoft": "Error"
      }
    },
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

## Filtering in code.

The below code snippet configures `ApplicationInsights` to capture only logs of `Warning` and above from all categories, `Error` and above from categories starting with 'Microsoft'. This is the equivalent of the above config done in appsettings.json.
```csharp
    WebHost.CreateDefaultBuilder(args)
    .UseStartup<Startup>()
    .ConfigureLogging(logging =>
        logging.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("", LogLevel.Warning)
               .AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("Microsoft", LogLevel.Error);
```


# Frequently Asked Questions

*1. What is the old and new ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider?*

* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNet SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore) shipped with a built-in ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider (Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore.Logging.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider), which was enabled using ILoggerFactory extension methods. This is marked obsolete from 2.7.0-beta2 onwards and will be removed completely in the next major version change. 

* The suggested alternative is the new package [Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights), containing an improved ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider (Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider), and extensions methods on ILoggerBuilder for enabling it.

* [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNet SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore) version 2.7.0-beta3 onwards will refer to the above package, and enables ILogger capture automatically.

*2. I am seeing some ILogger logs are shown twice in Application Insights?*

* This is possible if you have the older (now obsolete) version of `ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider` enabled by calling `AddApplicationInsights` on `ILoggerFactory`. Check if your `Configure` method has
  the following, and remove it.

   ```csharp
    public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
    {
        loggerFactory.AddApplicationInsights(app.ApplicationServices, LogLevel.Warning);
        // ..other code.
    }
   ```

* If you are experiencing double logging when debugging from Visual Studio, then modify the code used to enable ApplicationInsights as follows, by setting `EnableDebugLogger` to be false. This is only relevant when debugging the application.

   ```csharp
    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        ApplicationInsightsServiceOptions options = new ApplicationInsightsServiceOptions();
        options.EnableDebugLogger = false;
        services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry(options);
        // ..other code.
    }
   ```

*3. I have already enabled old provider by using ILoggerFactory extension method 'AddApplicationInsights'. What are the benefits of migrating to the new ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider?*

  While old provider can still be used (its obsolete now and will be removed only in major version change to 3.xx), migrating to newer provider is highly recommended due to following reasons.
* 1. Previous provider did not support [scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-2.2#log-scopes). In the new provider, properties from scope are automatically added as custom properties to the collected telemetry.
  2. Logs can now be captured much earlier in the application startup pipeline. i.e Logs from Program and Startup classes can now be captured.
  3. With new provider, the filtering is done at the framework level itself. Filtering of logs to ApplicationInsights provider can be done in exact same way as for other providers, including built-in providers like Console, Debug etc. It is also possible to apply same filters to multiple providers.
  4. The [recommended](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/255) way in Asp.Net Core (2.0 onwards) to enable logging providers is by using extension methods on ILoggingBuilder in `Program.cs` itself.

*4. I updated to [Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNet SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore) version 2.7.0-beta3, and I am now seeing that logs from ILogger are captured automatically. How can I turn this feature completely off?*

* Please see [this](../../azure-monitor/app/ilogger.md#control-logging-level) section to know how to filter logs in general. To completely turn-off ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider use `LogLevel.None` for it.

  In code
    ```csharp
        builder.AddFilter<Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider>("", LogLevel.None);
    ```
  In config

    ```json
    {
      "Logging": {
        "ApplicationInsights": {
          "LogLevel": {
            "Default": "None"
          }
    }
    ```

*5. I am seeing some ILogger logs are not having same properties as others?*

* ApplicationInsights captures and sends ILogger logs using the same `TelemetryConfiguration` used for every other telemetry. There is an exception to this rule. The default `TelemetryConfiguration` is not fully set up when logging something from `Program.cs` or `Startup.cs` itself, so those logs will not have the default configuration, and hence will not be running all the TelemetryInitializers and TelemetryProcessors.

*6. What ApplicationInsights telemetry type is produced from ILogger logs? or Where can I see ILogger logs in Application Insights?*
* ApplicationInsightsLoggerProvider captures ILogger logs and creates `TraceTelemetry` from it. If an Exception object is passed to the Log() method on ILogger, then instead of `TraceTelemetry`, an `ExceptionTelemetry` is created. These telemetry can be found in same places as any other `TraceTelemetry` or `ExceptionTelemetry` for Application Insights, including portal, analytics, or Visual Studio local debugger.
If you prefer to always send `TraceTelemetry`, then use the snippet ```builder.AddApplicationInsights((opt) => opt.TrackExceptionsAsExceptionTelemetry = false);```.
