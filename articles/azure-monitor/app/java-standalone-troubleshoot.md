# Troubleshooting Azure Monitor Application Insights Java

## Configuration Issues

If you are using an old `applicationinsights.json` file, please make sure you make following changes in the configuration:

1.  Please rename `ApplicationInsights.json` to `applicationinsights.json`.
2.  Please remove `instrumentationSettings`. All the contents inside `instrumentationSettings` are moved to the root level.  
3.  Sub configurations like `sampling`, `jmxMetrics`, `instrumentation` and `heartbeat` are moved out of `preview` to the root level.

For more information please go through the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/app/java-standalone-config) related to different configuration options.

## SSL Certificate Issues

If you are using the default Java keystore, it will already have all of the CA root certificates and you should not need to import any further SSL certificates.

If you are using a custom Java keystore, you may need to import the Application Insights Endpoint SSL Certificates into it.

### Some key terminology:
*Keystore* is basically a repository of certificates, public and private keys. Usually JDK distributions have an executable to manage them – *keytool*

The following example is a simple command to import a SSL certificate to the keystore:

`keytool -importcert -alias your_ssl_certificate -file “your downloaded SSL certificate name”.cer -keystore “Your KeyStore name” -storepass “Your keystore password” -noprompt`

> [!NOTE]
> If the KeyStore doesn't exist, it'll be automatically generated.

### Steps to download and add the SSL Certificate:

1.	Open your favorite browser and go to the `IngestionEndpoint` url present in the Connection String used to instrument your application as shown below

2.	Click on the 'View site information' (lock) icon on the browser and click on 'Certificate' option as show below

3.	Go to details tab and click copy to file.
4.	Click the next button and select “Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)” format and select next.

5.	Specify the file you want to save the SSL certificate to. Finally click next and finish. You should see "The export was successful" message.
6.	Once you have the certificate its time to import the certificate into a Java keystore. Use the above [command](#some-key-terminology) to import certificates.

> [!WARNING]
> You will need to repeat these steps to get the new certificate before the current certificate expires. You can find the expiration information in the "Details" tab of the Certificate popup as shown below
