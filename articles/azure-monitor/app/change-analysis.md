# Azure Monitor application change analysis (public preview)

When a live site issue/outage occurs determining root cause quickly is critical. Standard monitoring solutions may help you rapidly identify that there is a problem, and often even what component is failing. But this won't always lead to to an immediate answer of why the failure is occuring. Your site worked five minutes ago, now it's broken, what changed in the last five minutes? This is the question that the new feature Azure Monitor application change analysis is designed to answer. By building on the power of the [Azure Resource Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview) application change analysis provides insight into your Azure App Service application changes to increase observabilty and reduce MTTR (Mean Time To Repair).

> [!IMPORTANT]

> This preview version is provided without a service level agreement, and it's not recommended for production workloads. Certain features might not be supported or might have constrained capabilities.
