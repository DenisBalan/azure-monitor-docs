# Azure Monitor Agent Health

This article provides an overview for the **Azure Monitor Agent Health** experience that provides an at scale solution for viewing the health of agents deployed across your organization.  
It includes agents deployed across virtual machines, scale sets and [Arc-enabled servers](../../azure-arc/servers/overview.md) (on premise servers with Azure Arc installed), as well as the [data collection rules](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md) managing the agents across all these resources.
