# Collect events and performance counters from virtual machines with Azure Monitor Agent

To collect data from Azure virtual machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Arc-enabled on-premises servers using [Azure Monitor Agent](azure-monitor-agent-overview.md), [create a data collection rule (DCR)](../essentials/data-collection-rule-create-edit.md) and associate it with your machines. The data collection rule defines which data Azure Monitor Agent collects from which machines, and where you want to store the collected data. When you create a data collection rule in the Azure portal, the portal automatically installs Azure Monitor Agent on the selected machines.         

This article explains how to configure data collection of events and performance counters from virtual machines, Virtual Machine Scale Sets, and Arc-enabled on-premises servers using Azure Monitor Agent.

> [!NOTE]
> To send data across tenants, you must first enable [Azure Lighthouse](../../lighthouse/overview.md).

## Prerequisites
To complete this procedure, you need: 

- Log Analytics workspace where you have at least [contributor rights](../logs/manage-access.md#azure-rbac).
- [Permissions to create Data Collection Rule objects](../essentials/data-collection-rule-create-edit.md#permissions) in the workspace.

## Configure collection of performance counters and events 

You can send performance counters to both Azure Monitor Metrics and Azure Monitor Logs. 

1. Create a data collection rule, as described in [Create a data collection rule](../essentials/data-collection-rule-create-edit.md).
1. In the **Collect and deliver** step, select **Performance Counters** or **Windows Event Logs** from the **Data source type** dropdown. 
1. For performance counters, select from a predefined set of objects and their sampling rate. For events, you can select from a set of logs and severity levels.

1. Select **Custom** to collect logs and performance counters that aren't [currently supported data sources](azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#data-sources-and-destinations) or to [filter events by using XPath queries](#filter-events-using-xpath-queries). You can then specify an [XPath](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) to collect any specific values.

    To collect a performance counter that's not available by default, use the format `\PerfObject(ParentInstance/ObjectInstance#InstanceIndex)\Counter`. If the counter name contains an ampersand (&), replace it with `&amp;`. For example, `\Memory\Free &amp; Zero Page List Bytes`.
   
    For examples of DCRs, see [Sample data collection rules (DCRs) in Azure Monitor](data-collection-rule-sample-agent.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> At this time, Microsoft.HybridCompute ([Azure Arc-enabled servers](../../azure-arc/servers/overview.md)) resources can't be viewed in [Metrics Explorer](../essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) (the Azure portal UX), but they can be acquired via the Metrics REST API (Metric Namespaces - List, Metric Definitions - List, and Metrics - List).

## Filter events using XPath queries

You're charged for any data you collect in a Log Analytics workspace. Therefore, you should only collect the event data you need. The basic configuration in the Azure portal provides you with a limited ability to filter out events.

[!INCLUDE [azure-monitor-cost-optimization](../../../includes/azure-monitor-cost-optimization.md)]

To specify more filters, use custom configuration and specify an XPath that filters out the events you don't need. XPath entries are written in the form `LogName!XPathQuery`. For example, you might want to return only events from the Application event log with an event ID of 1035. The `XPathQuery` for these events would be `*[System[EventID=1035]]`. Because you want to retrieve the events from the Application event log, the XPath is `Application!*[System[EventID=1035]]`

### Extract XPath queries from Windows Event Viewer

In Windows, you can use Event Viewer to extract XPath queries as shown in the screenshots.

When you paste the XPath query into the field on the **Add data source** screen, as shown in step 5, you must append the log type category followed by an exclamation point (!).

> [!TIP]
> You can use the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-WinEvent` with the `FilterXPath` parameter to test the validity of an XPath query locally on your machine first. For more information, see the tip provided in the [Windows agent-based connections](../../sentinel/connect-services-windows-based.md) instructions. The [`Get-WinEvent`](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.diagnostics/get-winevent) PowerShell cmdlet supports up to 23 expressions. Azure Monitor data collection rules support up to 20. The following script shows an example:
>
> ```powershell
> $XPath = '*[System[EventID=1035]]'
> Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Application' -FilterXPath $XPath
> ```
>
> - In the preceding cmdlet, the value of the `-LogName` parameter is the initial part of the XPath query until the exclamation point (!). The rest of the XPath query goes into the `$XPath` parameter.
> - If the script returns events, the query is valid.
> - If you receive the message "No events were found that match the specified selection criteria," the query might be valid but there are no matching events on the local machine.
> - If you receive the message "The specified query is invalid," the query syntax is invalid.

Examples of using a custom XPath to filter events:

| Description |  XPath |
|:---|:---|
| Collect only System events with Event ID = 4648 |  `System!*[System[EventID=4648]]`
| Collect Security Log events with Event ID = 4648 and a process name of consent.exe | `Security!*[System[(EventID=4648)]] and *[EventData[Data[@Name='ProcessName']='C:\Windows\System32\consent.exe']]` |
| Collect all Critical, Error, Warning, and Information events from the System event log except for Event ID = 6 (Driver loaded) |  `System!*[System[(Level=1 or Level=2 or Level=3) and (EventID != 6)]]` |
| Collect all success and failure Security events except for Event ID 4624 (Successful logon) |  `Security!*[System[(band(Keywords,13510798882111488)) and (EventID != 4624)]]` |

> [!NOTE]
> For a list of limitations in the XPath supported by Windows event log, see [XPath 1.0 limitations](/windows/win32/wes/consuming-events#xpath-10-limitations).  
> For instance, you can use the "position", "Band", and "timediff" functions within the query but other functions like "starts-with" and "contains" are not currently supported.


## Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to common questions.

#### How can I collect Windows security events by using Azure Monitor Agent?

There are two ways you can collect Security events using the new agent, when sending to a Log Analytics workspace:
- You can use Azure Monitor Agent to natively collect Security Events, same as other Windows Events. These flow to the [`Event`](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/Event) table in your Log Analytics workspace. 
- If you have Microsoft Sentinel enabled on the workspace, the security events flow via Azure Monitor Agent into the [`SecurityEvent`](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/SecurityEvent) table instead (the same as using the Log Analytics agent). This scenario always requires the solution to be enabled first.

### Will I duplicate events if I use Azure Monitor Agent and the Log Analytics agent on the same machine? 

If you're collecting the same events with both agents, duplication occurs. This duplication could be the legacy agent collecting redundant data from the [workspace configuration](./agent-data-sources.md) data, which is collected by the data collection rule. Or you might be collecting security events with the legacy agent and enable Windows security events with Azure Monitor Agent connectors in Microsoft Sentinel.
          
Limit duplication events to only the time when you transition from one agent to the other. After you've fully tested the data collection rule and verified its data collection, disable collection for the workspace and disconnect any Microsoft Monitoring Agent data connectors.

### Does Azure Monitor Agent offer more granular event filtering options other than Xpath queries and specifying performance counters?

For Syslog events on Linux, you can select facilities and the log level for each facility.

### If I create data collection rules that contain the same event ID and associate them to the same VM, will events be duplicated?

Yes. To avoid duplication, make sure the event selection you make in your data collection rules doesn't contain duplicate events.
