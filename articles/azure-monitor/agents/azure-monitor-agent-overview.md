# Azure Monitor Agent overview

Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) collects monitoring data from the guest operating system of Azure and hybrid virtual machines and delivers it to Azure Monitor for use by features, insights, and other services such as [Microsoft Sentinel](../../sentintel/../sentinel/overview.md) and [Microsoft Defender for Cloud](../../defender-for-cloud/defender-for-cloud-introduction.md). This article provides an overview of Azure Monitor Agent's capabilities and supported use cases.

Here's a short **introduction to Azure Monitor agent video**, which includes a quick demo of how to set up the agent from the Azure portal:  [ITOps Talk: Azure Monitor Agent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8bIrFU8tCs)

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Monitor Agent replaces the [Legacy Agent](./log-analytics-agent.md) for Azure Monitor. The Log Analytics agent is on a **deprecation path** and won't be supported after **August 31, 2024**. Any new data centers brought online after January 1 2024 will not support the Log Analytics agent. If you use the Log Analytics agent to ingest data to Azure Monitor, [migrate to the new Azure Monitor agent](./azure-monitor-agent-migration.md) prior to that date. 

## Basic operation
The Azure Monitor agent is one method of [data collection for Azure Monitor](../data-sources.md). It's installed on virtual machines running in Azure, in other clouds, or on-premises where it has access to local logs and performance data. Without the agent, you could only collect data from the host machine since you would have no access to the client operating system and running processes.

### Installation
The agent can be installed using different methods as described in [Manage Azure Monitor Agent](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md). You can install the agent on a single machine or at scale using Azure Policy or other tools. In some cases, the agent will be automatically installed when you enable a feature that requires it, such as Microsoft Sentinel.

### Data collection
All data collected by the Azure Monitor agent is done with a [data collection rule (DCR)](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md) where you define the following:

- Data type being collected.
- Configuration of the data including filtering for required data.
- Destination for collected data.

The DCR is applied to a particular agent by creating a [data collection rule association (DCRA)](../essentials/data-collection-rule-overview.md#data-collection-rule-associations-dcra) between the DCR and the agent. One DCR can be associated with multiple agents, and each agent can be associated with multiple DCRs. When an agent is installed, it connects to Azure Monitor to retrieve any DCRs that are associated with it. The agent periodically checks back with Azure Monitor to determine if there are any changes to existing DCRs or associations with new ones.

A single DCR can contain multiple data sources of different types. Depending on your requirements, you can choose whether to include several data sources in a few DCRs or create separate DCRs for each data source. This allows you to centrally define the logic for different data collection scenarios and apply them to different sets of machines. See [Best practices for data collection rule creation and management in Azure Monitor](../essentials/data-collection-rule-best-practices.md) for recommendations on how to organize your DCRs.

## Install the agent and configure data collection


> [!NOTE]
> To send data across tenants, you must first enable [Azure Lighthouse](../../lighthouse/overview.md).
> Cloning a machine with Azure Monitor Agent installed is not supported. The best practice for these situations is to use [Azure Policy](../../azure-arc/servers/deploy-ama-policy.md) or an Infrastructure as a code tool to deploy AMA at scale.

**To collect data using Azure Monitor Agent:**

1. Install the agent on the resource.

    | Resource type | Installation method | More information |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | Virtual machines and VM scale sets | [Virtual machine extension](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#virtual-machine-extension-details) | Installs the agent by using Azure extension framework. |
    | On-premises Arc-enabled servers | [Virtual machine extension](./azure-monitor-agent-manage.md#virtual-machine-extension-details) (after installing the [Azure Arc agent](../../azure-arc/servers/deployment-options.md)) | Installs the agent by using Azure extension framework, provided for on-premises by first installing [Azure Arc agent](../../azure-arc/servers/deployment-options.md). |
    | Windows 10, 11 Client Operating Systems | [Client installer](./azure-monitor-agent-windows-client.md) | Installs the agent by using a Windows MSI installer. The installer works on laptops, but the agent *isn't optimized yet* for battery or network consumption. |

1. Define a data collection rule and associate the resource to the rule.

    The table below lists the types of data you can currently collect with the Azure Monitor Agent and where you can send that data.

    | Data source | Destinations | Description |
    |:---|:---|:---|
    | Performance | <ul><li>Azure Monitor Metrics (Public preview):<ul><li>For Windows - Virtual Machine Guest namespace</li><li>For Linux<sup>1</sup> - azure.vm.linux.guestmetrics namespace</li></ul></li><li>Log Analytics workspace - [Perf](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/perf) table</li></ul> | Numerical values measuring performance of different aspects of operating system and workloads |
    | Windows event logs (including sysmon events) | Log Analytics workspace - [Event](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/Event) table | Information sent to the Windows event logging system |
    | Syslog | Log Analytics workspace - [Syslog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/syslog)<sup>2</sup> table | Information sent to the Linux event logging system. [Collect syslog with Azure Monitor Agent](data-collection-syslog.md) |
    |	Text and JSON logs	|	Log Analytics workspace - custom table(s) created manually |	[Collect text logs with Azure Monitor Agent](data-collection-text-log.md)	|
    | Windows IIS logs |Internet Information Service (IIS) logs from to the local disk of Windows machines |[Collect IIS Logs with Azure Monitor Agent].(data-collection-iis.md) |
    | Windows Firewall logs | Firewall logs from the local disk of a Windows Machine| |


    <sup>1</sup> On Linux, using Azure Monitor Metrics as the only destination is supported in v1.10.9.0 or higher.<br>
    <sup>2</sup> Azure Monitor Linux Agent versions 1.15.2 and higher support syslog RFC formats including Cisco Meraki, Cisco ASA, Cisco FTD, Sophos XG, Juniper Networks, Corelight Zeek, CipherTrust, NXLog, McAfee, and Common Event Format (CEF).

    > [!NOTE]
    > On rsyslog-based systems, Azure Monitor Linux Agent adds forwarding rules to the default ruleset defined in the rsyslog configuration. If multiple rulesets are used, inputs bound to non-default ruleset(s) are **not** forwarded to Azure Monitor Agent. For more information about multiple rulesets in rsyslog, see the [official documentation](https://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/concepts/multi_ruleset.html).

    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure Monitor Agent also supports Azure service [SQL Best Practices Assessment](/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/assess/) which is currently Generally available. For more information, refer [Configure best practices assessment using Azure Monitor Agent](/sql/sql-server/azure-arc/assess#enable-best-practices-assessment).



## Frequently asked questions

This section provides answers to common questions.

### Does Azure Monitor require an agent?

An agent is only required to collect data from the operating system and workloads in virtual machines. The virtual machines can be located in Azure, another cloud environment, or on-premises. See [Azure Monitor Agent overview](./agents-overview.md).

### Does Azure Monitor Agent support data collection for the various Log Analytics solutions and Azure services like Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Sentinel?

For a list of features and services that use Azure Monitor Agent for data collection, see [Migrate to Azure Monitor Agent from Log Analytics agent](../agents/azure-monitor-agent-migration.md#migrate-additional-services-and-features).

Some services might install other extensions to collect more data or to transforms or process data, and then use Azure Monitor Agent to route the final data to Azure Monitor.

The following diagram explains the new extensibility architecture.

:::image type="content" source="./media/azure-monitor-agent/extensibility-arch-new.png" lightbox="./media/azure-monitor-agent/extensibility-arch-new.png" alt-text="Diagram that shows extensions architecture.":::

### Does Azure Monitor Agent support non-Azure environments like other clouds or on-premises?

Both on-premises machines and machines connected to other clouds are supported for servers today, after you have the Azure Arc agent installed. For purposes of running Azure Monitor Agent and data collection rules, the Azure Arc requirement comes at *no extra cost or resource consumption*. The Azure Arc agent is only used as an installation mechanism. You don't need to enable the paid management features if you don't want to use them.

### Does Azure Monitor Agent support auditd logs on Linux or AUOMS?

Yes, but you need to [onboard to Defender for Cloud](./azure-monitor-agent-overview.md#supported-services-and-features) (previously Azure Security Center). It's available as an extension to Azure Monitor Agent, which collects Linux auditd logs via AUOMS.

### Why do I need to install the Azure Arc Connected Machine agent to use Azure Monitor Agent?

Azure Monitor Agent authenticates to your workspace via managed identity, which is created when you install the Connected Machine agent. Managed Identity is a more secure and manageable authentication solution from Azure. The legacy Log Analytics agent authenticated by using the workspace ID and key instead, so it didn't need Azure Arc.

## Next steps

- [Install the Azure Monitor Agent](azure-monitor-agent-manage.md) on Windows and Linux virtual machines.
- [Create a data collection rule](data-collection-rule-azure-monitor-agent.md) to collect data from the agent and send it to Azure Monitor.
