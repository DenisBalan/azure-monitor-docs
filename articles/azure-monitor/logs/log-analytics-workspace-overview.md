# Log Analytics workspace overview
Azure Monitor Logs stores the data that it collects in one or more [Log Analytics workspaces](./design-logs-deployment.md). A workspace defines:

- The geographic location of the data.
- Access rights that define which users can access data.
- Configuration settings such as the pricing tier and data retention.  

You must create at least one workspace to use Azure Monitor Logs. A single workspace might be sufficient for all of your monitoring data, or you might choose to create multiple workspaces depending on your requirements. For example, you might have one workspace for your production data and another for testing. 

To create a new workspace, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](./quick-create-workspace.md). For considerations on creating multiple workspaces, see [Designing your Azure Monitor Logs deployment](design-logs-deployment.md).

## Data structure
Log queries retrieve their data from a Log Analytics workspace. Each workspace contains multiple tables that are organized into separate columns with multiple rows of data. Each table is defined by a unique set of columns. Rows of data provided by the data source share those columns.

Log data from Application Insights is also stored in Azure Monitor Logs, but it's stored differently depending on how your application is configured: 

- For a workspace-based application, data is stored in a Log Analytics workspace in a standard set of tables. The types of data include application requests, exceptions, and page views. Multiple applications can use the same workspace. 

- For a classic application, the data is not stored in a Log Analytics workspace. It uses the same query language, and you create and run queries by using the same Log Analytics tool in the Azure portal. Data items for classic applications are stored separately from each other. The general structure is the same as for workspace-based applications, although the table and column names are different. 

For a detailed comparison of the schema for workspace-based and classic applications, see [Workspace-based resource changes](../app/apm-tables.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The classic Application Insights experience includes backward compatibility for your resource queries, workbooks, and log-based alerts. To query or view against the [new workspace-based table structure or schema](../app/apm-tables.md), you must first go to your Log Analytics workspace. During the preview, selecting **Logs** from within the Application Insights panes will give you access to the classic Application Insights query experience. For more information, see [Query scope](./scope.md).

## Log data plans
By default, all tables in a workspace are **Archive Logs** which are available to all features of Azure Monitor and any other services that use the workspace. You can configure certain tables as **Basic Logs (preview)** which reduces the cost for high-value verbose logs that donâ€™t require analytics and alerts.

You can configure certain data in the workspace as a different log type to optimize your cost in exchange for reduced features. The following table gives a brief summary of the different types. Follow the links for each for complete details.

The following table summarizes the differences between the plans.

| Category | Archive Logs | Basic Logs |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Ingestion | Cost for ingestion. | Reduced cost for ingestion. |
| Log queries | No additional cost. Full query language. | Additional cost. Subset of query language. |
| Retention |  Configure retention from 30 days to 750 days. | Retention fixed at 8 days. |
| Alerts | Supported. | Not supported. |



## Data retention and archive
Data in each table in a [Log Analytics workspace](log-analytics-workspace-overview.md) is retained for a specified period of time after which it's either removed or moved to archive with a reduced retention fee. Set the retention time to balance your requirement for having data available with reducing your cost for data retention. 

### Accessing archived logs
To access archived data, you must first retrieve data from it in an Analytics Logs table using one of the following methods:

[Search Jobs](search-jobs.md) are log queries that run asynchronously and make their results available as an Analytics Logs table that you can use with standard log queries. Search jobs are charged according to the volume of data they scan, not just the data they return. Use a search job when you need to access to a specific set of records in your archived data.

[Restore](restore.md) allows you to temporarily make data from an archived table within a particular time range available as an Analytics Logs table and allocates additional compute resources to handle its processing. Restore is charge according to the volume of the data it retrieves and the duration that data is made available. Use restore when you have a temporary need to run a number of queries on large volume of data. 

> [!NOTE]
> During public preview there is no charge for archived logs and restore. The only charge for search jobs is for the ingestion of the search results.
