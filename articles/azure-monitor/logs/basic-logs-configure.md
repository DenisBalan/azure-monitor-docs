# Configure Basic Logs in Azure Monitor (Preview)
[Basic Logs](log-analytics-workspace-overview.md#log-data-plans-preview) in Azure Monitor reduce the cost of high-volume verbose logs you use for debugging, troubleshooting and auditing, but not for analytics and alerts. This article describes how to configure Basic Logs for a particular table in your Log Analytics workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Switching between plans is limited to once a week.

## Which tables support Basic Logs?
All tables in your Log Analytics are Analytics tables, by default. You can configure particular tables to use Basic Logs. You cannot configure a table for Basic Logs if Azure Monitor relies on that table for specific features.

You can currently configure the following tables for Basic Logs:

- All tables created with [custom logs.](custom-logs-overview.md) 
-	[ContainerLog](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/containerlog) and [ContainerLogV2](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/containerlogv2), which [Container Insights](../containers/container-insights-overview.md) uses and which include verbose text-based log records.
- [AppTraces](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/apptraces), which contains freeform log records for application traces in Application Insights.

> [!NOTE]
> Tables created with the [Data Collector API](data-collector-api.md) do not support Basic Logs.
## Data retention and archiving of Basic Logs

Analytics tables retain data for a retention period you set.

Basic Logs tables retain data for eight. When you change the configuration of an existing table from Analytics to Basic Logs, Azure archive data that is more than eight days old but still within the original retention period you set.

For more information, see [Configure data retention and archive in Azure Monitor Logs](data-retention-archive.md).


## Set table configuration
Call the **Tables - Update** API or use the [Azure CLI](azure-cli-log-analytics-workspace-sample.md#configure-basic-logs-and-analytics-tables) to configure a plan for a table. 

You can configure the table for Basic Logs or Analytics:

```http
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscriptionId>/resourcegroups/<resourceGroupName>/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/<workspaceName>/tables/<tableName>?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to use the Bearer token for authentication. [Read More](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/51140.azure-rest-management-api-the-quickest-way-to-get-your-bearer-token.aspx)

### Request Body
|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|properties.plan | string  | The table plan. Possible values are *Analytics* and *Basic*.|

## Example
The following example configures the `ContainerLog` table for Basic Logs.
### Sample Request

```http
PUT https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/ContosoSID/resourcegroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/ContosoWorkspace/tables/ContainerLog?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

Use the following request body to change to Basic Logs:

```http
{
    "properties": {
        "plan": "Basic"
    }
}
```

Use the following request body to change to Analytics Logs:

```http
{
    "properties": {
        "plan": "Analytics"
    }
}
```

### Sample Response
The following response is for a table changed to Basic Logs.

Status code: 200

```http
{
    "properties": {
        "retentionInDays": 8,
        "totalRetentionInDays": 30,
        "archiveRetentionInDays": 22,
        "plan": "Basic",
        "lastPlanModifiedDate": "2022-01-01T14:34:04.37",
        "schema": {...}        
    },
    "id": "subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000000/resourcegroups/testRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/testWS/tables/ContainerLog",
    "name": "ContainerLog"
}
```


## Check table configuration
You can check the configuration for a particular table from Log Analytics in the Azure portal. From the **Azure Monitor** menu, select **Logs** and then make sure that your workspace is selected for the [scope](scope.md). Open the **Tables** tab, which lists all the tables in the workspace. See [Log Analytics tutorial](log-analytics-tutorial.md#view-table-information) for a walkthrough.

When browsing the list of tables, Basic Logs tables are identified with a unique icon: 

![Screenshot of the Basic Logs table icon in the table list.](./media/basic-logs-configure/table-icon.png)

You can also hover over a table name for the table information view. This will specify that the table is configured as Basic Logs:

![Screenshot of the Basic Logs table indicator in the table details.](./media/basic-logs-configure/table-info.png)

You can also use **Tables - Get** API call to check whether the table is configured as _Basic Logs_ or _Analytics Logs_.

```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourcegroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/{workspaceName}/tables/{tableName}?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```

### Response Body
|Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|properties.plan | string  | The table plan. Either "Analytics" or "Basic". |
|properties.retentionInDays | integer  | The table's data retention in days. In _Basic Logs_, the value is 8 days, fixed. In _Analytics Logs_, between 7 and 730.| 
|properties.totalRetentionInDays | integer  | The table's data retention including Archive period|
|properties.archiveRetentionInDays|integer|The table's archive period (read-only, calculated).|
|properties.lastPlanModifiedDate|String|Last time when plan was set for this table. Null if no change was ever done from the default settings (read-only) 

### Sample Request
```http
GET https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/ContosoSID/resourcegroups/ContosoRG/providers/Microsoft.OperationalInsights/workspaces/ContosoWorkspace/tables/ContainerLog?api-version=2021-12-01-preview
```


### Sample Response 
Status code: 200
