# Explore log data in Azure Monitor using Log Analytics simple mode 


Log Analytics simple mode is a spreadsheet-like interface for navigating through your logs and reaching insights without writing queries. Similar to working with data in Excel, you can scroll through entries, search for specific values, filter and sort, hide columns you don't need, and aggregate data, all without any query language expertise.

This article describes how to use simple query mode in Log Analytics.     

## Switch back and forth between simple and advanced mode

To switch to simple mode, select **Simple mode** from the dropdown in the top right corner of the query editor. To switch back to advanced mode, select **Advanced mode** from the same dropdown.


When you switch from simple to advanced mode, the query editor populates the query for the work you did in simple mode. You can then edit the query as needed.
 
## Next steps

- Access the complete [reference documentation for KQL](/azure/kusto/query/).
