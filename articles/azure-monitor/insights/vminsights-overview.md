# What is Azure Monitor for VMs?

Azure Monitor for VMs monitors the performance and health of your virtual machines and virtual machine scale sets, including their running processes and dependencies on other resources. It can help deliver predictable performance and availability of vital applications by identifying performance bottlenecks and network issues and can also help you understand whether an issue is related to other dependencies.

Azure Monitor for VMs supports Windows and Linux operating systems on the following:

- Azure virtual machines
- Azure virtual machine scale sets
- Hybrid virtual machines connected with Azure Arc
- On-premises virtual machines
- Virtual machines hosted in another cloud environment
  


>[!NOTE]
>We recently [announced changes](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/updates-to-azure-monitor-for-virtual-machines-preview-before-general-availability-release/
) we are making to the Health feature based on the feedback we have received from our public preview customers. Given the number of changes we will be making, we are going to stop offering the Health feature for new customers. Existing customers can continue to use the health feature. For more details, please refer to our [General Availability FAQ](vminsights-ga-release-faq.md).  


Azure Monitor for VMs stores its data in Azure Monitor Logs which allows it to deliver powerful aggregation and filtering and to analyze data trends over time. You can view this data in a single VM from the virtual machine directly, or you can use Azure Monitor to deliver an aggregated view of multiple VMs.

## Pricing
There is no direct cost for Azure Monitor for VMs, but you are charged for its activity in the Log Analytics workspace. Based on the pricing that's published on the [Azure Monitor pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/), Azure Monitor for VMs is billed for:

- Data ingested from agents and stored in the workspace.
- Alert rules based on log and health data.
- Notifications sent from alert rules.

The log size varies by the string lengths of performance counters, and it can increase with the number of logical disks and network adapters allocated to the VM. If you're already using Service Map, the only change you'll see is the additional connection data that's sent to Azure Monitor.â€‹

## Supported Azure Arc machines
Azure Monitor for VMs is available for Azure Arc enabled servers in regions where the Arc extension service is available. Users must be running version 0.9 or above of the Arc Agent to enable Azure Monitor for VMs on their Arc enabled servers.

## Supported operating systems

The following table lists the Windows and Linux operating systems that Azure Monitor for VMs supports. Later in this section, you'll find a full list that details the major and minor Linux OS release and supported kernel versions.

<sup>1</sup> The Performance feature of Azure Monitor for VMs is available only from Azure Monitor. It isn't available directly from the left pane of the Azure VM.

>[!NOTE]
>In the Linux operating system:
> - Only default and SMP Linux kernel releases are supported.
> - Nonstandard kernel releases, such as Physical Address Extension (PAE) and Xen, aren't supported for any Linux distribution. For example, a system with the release string of *2.6.16.21-0.8-xen* isn't supported.
> - Custom kernels, including recompilations of standard kernels, aren't supported.
> - CentOSPlus kernel is supported.
> - The Linux kernel must be patched for the Spectre vulnerability. Please consult your Linux distribution vendor for more details.

## Role-based access control

To enable and access the features in Azure Monitor for VMs, you must have the *Log Analytics contributor* role. To view performance, health, and map data, you must have the *monitoring reader* role for the Azure VM. The Log Analytics workspace must be configured for Azure Monitor for VMs.

For more information about how to control access to a Log Analytics workspace, see [Manage workspaces](../../azure-monitor/platform/manage-access.md).



 see [access modes overview](../platform/design-logs-deployment.md#access-mode).
