# Enable Azure Monitor for single VM or VMSS in the Azure portal
This article describes how to enable Azure Monitor for VMs for a virtual machine or virtual machine scale set using the Azure portal. This procedure can be used for the following:

- Azure virtual machine
- Azure virtual machine scale set
- Hybrid virtual machine connected with Azure Arc

## Prerequisites

- [Create and configure a Log Analytics workspace](vminsights-configure-workspace.md). Alternatively, you can create a new workspace during this process.
- See [Supported operating systems](vminsights-enable-overview#supported-operating-systems) to ensure that the operating system of the VM or VMSS you're enabling is supported. 

## Enable Azure Monitor for VMs

From the Azure portal, select **Virtual machines**, **Virtual machine scale sets**, or **Machines - Azure Arc** and select a resource from the list. In the **Monitoring** section of the menu, select **Insights** and then **Enable**. The following example shows an Azure virtual machine, but the menu is similar for Azure VMSS or Azure Arc.

If the VM isn't already connected to a Log Analytics workspace, then you'll be prompted to select one. If you haven't previously [created a workspace](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md), then you can select a default for the location where the VM or VMSS is deployed in the subscription. This workspace will be created and configured if it doesn't already exist. If you select an existing workspace, it will be configured for Azure Monitor for VMs if it wasn't already.

You will receive status messages as the configuration is performed.

>[!NOTE]
>If you use a manual upgrade model for your virtual machine scale set, upgrade the instances to complete the setup. You can start the upgrades from the **Instances** page, in the **Settings** section.
