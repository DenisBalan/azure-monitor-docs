# Overview of Insights in Azure Monitor
Insights provide a customized monitoring experience for particular Azure services. They are based on the Azure Monitor data platform and other features in Azure Monitor but may collect additional data and provide a unique experience in the Azure portal. Access insights from the **Insights** section of the Azure Monitor menu in the Azure portal.

The following sections provide a brief description of the insights that are currently available in Azure Monitor. See the detailed documentation for details on each.

## Application Insights
Application Insights is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for web developers on multiple platforms. Use it to monitor your live web application. It works for applications on a wide variety of platforms including .NET, Node.js and Java EE, hosted on-premises, hybrid, or any public cloud. It also integrates with your DevOps process and has connection points to a variety of development tools.

See [What is Application Insights?](../apps/app-insights-overview.md).

## Azure Monitor for Containers
Azure Monitor for containers monitors the performance of container workloads deployed to either Azure Container Instances or managed Kubernetes clusters hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Monitoring your containers is critical, especially when you're running a production cluster, at scale, with multiple applications.

See [Azure Monitor for containers overview](../insights/container-insights-overview.md).

## Azure Monitor for Resource Groups
Azure Monitor for resource groups helps to triage and diagnose any problems your individual resources encounter, while offering context as to the health and performance of the resource group as a whole.

See [Monitor resource groups with Azure Monitor (preview)](../insights/resource-group-insights.md).
