# Understand AKS cluster health with Azure Monitor for containers

With Azure Monitor for containers, it monitors and reports health status of the managed infrastructure components, all nodes, and workloads running on a cluster deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and AKS Engine running on-premises and on Azure Stack. This experience extends beyond the cluster health status calculated and reported on the [multi-cluster view](container-insights-analyze.md#multi-cluster-view-from-azure-monitor), where now you can understand if one or more nodes in the cluster are resource constrained, or a node or pod are unavailable that could impact a running application in the cluster based on curated metrics. 

For information about how to enable Azure Monitor for containers, see [Onboard Azure Monitor for containers](container-insights-onboard.md).

## Overview

In Azure Monitor for containers, the Health feature provides proactive health monitoring of your Kubernetes cluster to help you identify and diagnose issues. It gives you the ability to view significant issues detected. Monitors evaluating the health of your cluster run on the containerized agent in your cluster, and the data collected is written to the **KubeHealth** table in your Log Analytics workspace. 

Kubernetes cluster health is based on a number of monitoring scenarios organized by the following Kubernetes objects and abstractions:

- Kubernetes infrastructure - provides a rollup of the Kubernetes API server, ReplicaSets, and DaemonSets running on nodes deployed in your cluster by evaluating CPU and memory utilization, and a Pods availability

- Nodes - provides a rollup of the Node pools and state of individual Nodes in each pool, by evaluating CPU and memory utilization, and a Nodes availability.

All monitors are shown in a hierarchical layout, where an aggregate monitor representing the Kubernetes object or abstraction (that is, Kubernetes infrastructure or Nodes) are the top-most monitor reflecting the combined health of all dependent child monitors. The key monitoring scenarios used to derive health are:

* Evaluate CPU utilization from the node and container.
* Evaluate memory utilization from the node and container.
* Status of Pods and Nodes based on calculation of their ready state reported by Kubernetes.

The icons used to indicate state are as follows:

|Icon|Meaning|  
|--------|-----------|  
|![Green check icon indicates healthy](./media/container-insights-health/healthyicon.png)|Success, health is OK (green)|  
|![Yellow triangle and exclamation mark is warning](./media/container-insights-health/warningicon.png)|Warning (yellow)|  
|![Red button with white X indicates critical state](./media/container-insights-health/criticalicon.png)|Critical (red)|  
|![Grayed-out icon](./media/container-insights-health/grayicon.png)|Unknown (gray)|  

## Monitor configuration (put into its own article)

To understand the behavior and configuration of each monitor supporting Azure Monitor for containers Health feature, see [article name].

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). 

## View health of an AKS or non-AKS cluster

Access to the Azure Monitor for containers Health feature is available directly from an AKS cluster by selecting **Insights** from the left pane in the Azure portal. Under the **Insights** section, select **Containers**. 

To view health from a non-AKS cluster, that is an AKS Engine cluster hosted on-premises or on Azure Stack, select **Azure Monitor** from the left pane in the Azure portal. Under the **Insights** section, select **Containers**.  On the multi-cluster page, select the non-AKS cluster from the list.

In Azure Monitor for containers, from the **Cluster** page, select **Health**.

## Review cluster health

When the Health page opens, by default **Kubernetes Infrastructure** is selected in the **Health Aspect** grid.  The grid summarizes current health rollup state of Kubernetes infrastructure and cluster nodes. Selecting either health aspect updates the results in the middle-pane and shows all child monitors in a hierarchical layout, displaying their current health state. To view more information about any dependent monitor, you can select one and a property pane automatically displays on the right side of the page. 

![Cluster health property pane](./media/container-insights-health/health-view-property-pane.png)

On the property pane, you learn the following:

- On the **Overview** tab, it shows the current state of the monitor selected, when the monitor was last calculated, and when the last state change occurred. Additional information is shown depending on the type of monitor selected in the hierarchy.

    If you select an aggregate monitor, the pane shows a rollup of the total number of aggregate monitors in the hierarchy, and how many aggregate monitors are in a critical, warning, and healthy state. 

    ![Health property pane Overview tab for aggregate monitor](./media/container-insights-health/health-view-overview-aggregate-monitor.png)

    If you select a child monitor, it also shows the previous samples calculated and reported by the agent within the last four hours under **Last state change**. When you select CPU or memory utilization of a Node or Pod, it shows the last three samples. When you select the status of a Pod or Node, it shows the last two samples.
    
    ![Health property pane Overview tab](./media/container-insights-health/health-overview-unit-montior.png)    

    If the time range for **Last state change** is a day or older, this is the result of not receiving data from the agent for more than four hours. If the agent knows that a particular resource exists, for example a Node, but hasnt received data from the node, then it marks the node monitos (Node CPU/Memory) as Unknown 

    When you select an aggregate monitor, 

    

- On the**Config** tab, it shows the default configuration parameter settings (only for monitors, not aggregate monitors) and their values.
- On the **Knowledge** tab, it contains information explaining the behavior of the monitor and how it evaluates for the unhealthy condition.

Monitoring data on this page does not refresh automatically and you need to select **Refresh** at the top of the page to see the most recent health state based on the latest records received from the cluster.
