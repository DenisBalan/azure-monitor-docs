# How to view logs and events in real time (preview)

Azure Monitor for containers includes a feature, which is currently in preview, that provides a live view into your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container logs (stdout/stderr) and events without having to run kubectl commands. When you select either option, a new pane appears below the performance data table on the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, and **Containers** view. It shows live logging and events generated by the container engine to further assist in troubleshooting issues in real time.

# View live logs and events

You can view real-time log events as they are generated by the container engine from the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, and **Containers** view. From the properties pane, you select **View live data (preview)** option and a pane is presented below the performance data table where you can view log and events in a continuous stream.

Log and event messages are limited based on what resource type is selected in the view.

| View | Resource type | Log or event | Data presented |
|------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Nodes | Node | Event | When a node is selected events are not filtered and show cluster-wide Kubernetes events. The pane title shows the name of the cluster. |
| Nodes | Pod | Event | When a pod is selected events are filtered to its namespace. The pane title shows the namespace of the pod. | 
| Controllers | Pod | Event | When a pod is selected events are filtered to its namespace. The pane title shows the namespace of the pod. |
| Controllers | Controller | Event | When a controller is selected events are filtered to its namespace. The pane title shows the namespace of the controller. |
| Nodes/Controllers/Containers | Container | Logs | The pane title shows the name of the pod the container is grouped with. |

If the AKS cluster is configured with SSO using AAD, you are prompted to authenticate on first use during that browser session. Select your account and complete authentication with Azure.  

After successfully authenticating, the live log pane will appear in the bottom section of the middle pane. If the fetch status indicator shows a green check mark, which is on the far right of the pane, it means it can retrieve data.

In the search bar, you can filter by key word to highlight that text in the log or event, and in the search bar on the far right, it shows how many results match out the filter.

While viewing events, you can additionally limit the results using the **Filter** pill found to the right of the search bar. Depending on what resource you have selected, the pill lists a pod, namespace, or cluster to chose from.  

To suspend autoscroll and control the behavior of the pane and allow you to manually scroll through the new data read, click on the **Scroll** option. To re-enable autoscroll, simply click the **Scroll** option again. You can also pause retrieval of log or event data by clicking on the **Pause** option and when you are ready to resume, simply click **Play**.

You can go to Azure Monitor Logs to see historical container logs by selecting **View container logs** from the drop-down list **View in analytics**.
