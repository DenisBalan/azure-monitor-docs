# How to setup viewing logs and events in real time (preview)

Azure Monitor for containers includes a feature, which is currently in preview, that provides a live view into your Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) container logs (stdout/stderr) and events without having to run kubectl commands. When you select either option, a new pane appears below the performance data table on the **Nodes**, **Controllers**, and **Containers** view. It shows live logging and events generated by the container engine to further assist in troubleshooting issues in real time.

>[!NOTE]
>**Contributor** access to the cluster resource is required for this feature to work.

Live logs support three different methods to control access to the logs:

1. AKS without Kubernetes RBAC authorization enabled
2. AKS enabled with Kubernetes RBAC authorization
3. AKS enabled with Azure Active Directory (AD) SAML-based single-sign on

## Kubernetes cluster without RBAC enabled
 
If you have a Kubernetes cluster that is not configured with Kubernetes RBAC authorization or integrated with Azure AD single-sign on, you do not need to follow these steps. Because Kubernetes authorization uses the kube-api, read-only permissions are required.

## Kubernetes RBAC authorization

If you have enabled Kubernetes RBAC authorization, you will need to apply cluster role binding. The following example steps demonstrate how to configure cluster role binding from this yaml configuration template. 

1. Copy and paste the yaml file and save it as LogReaderRBAC.yaml.  

    ```
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 
    kind: ClusterRole 
    metadata: 
       name: containerHealth-log-reader 
    rules: 
       - apiGroups: [""] 
         resources: ["pods/log", "events"] 
         verbs: ["get", "list"]  
    --- 
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding 
    metadata: 
       name: containerHealth-read-logs-global 
    roleRef: 
        kind: ClusterRole 
        name: containerHealth-log-reader 
        apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io 
    subjects: 
       - kind: User 
         name: clusterUser 
         apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    ```

2. If you are configuring it for the first time, you apply the cluster rule binding by running the following command: `kubectl create -f LogReaderRBAC.yaml`. If you previously enabled support for live logs preview before we introduced live event logs, to update your configuration, run the following command: `kubectl apply -f LogReaderRBAC.yaml`.

## Configure AKS with Azure Active Directory

AKS can be configured to use Azure Active Directory (AD) for user authentication. If you are configuring it for the first time, see [Integrate Azure Active Directory with Azure Kubernetes Service](../../aks/azure-ad-integration.md). During the steps to create the [client application](../../aks/azure-ad-integration.md#create-the-client-application), specify the following:

-  **Redirect URI**: Two **Web** application types need to be created. The first base URL value should be `https://afd.hosting.portal.azure.net/monitoring/Content/iframe/infrainsights.app/web/base-libs/auth/auth.html` and the second base URL value should be `https://monitoring.hosting.portal.azure.net/monitoring/Content/iframe/infrainsights.app/web/base-libs/auth/auth.html`.
- After registering the application, from the **Overview** page select **Authentication** from the left-hand pane. On the **Authentication** page, under **Advanced settings** implicitly grant **Access tokens** and **ID tokens** and then save your changes.

>[!NOTE]
>Configuring authentication with Azure Active Directory for single-sign on can only be accomplished during initial deployment of a new AKS cluster. You cannot configure single-sign on for an AKS cluster already deployed.
  
>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you reconfigured Azure AD for user authentication using the updated URI, clear your browser's cache to ensure the updated authentication token is downloaded and applied. 

## Next steps

Now that you have setup authentication for viewing log data, you can view live [metric data from the cluster](container-insights-livelogs-metrics.md), [deployments](container-insights-livelogs-deployments.md), [console events](container-insights-livelogs-events.md), [console logs](container-insights-livelogs-logs.md), [pod metrics](container-insights-livelogs-podmetrics.md).
