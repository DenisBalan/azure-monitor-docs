# Azure Monitor for containers health monitor configuration guide

## Monitors

A monitor measures the health of some aspect of a managed object. Monitors each have either two or three health states. A monitor will be in one and only one of its potential states at any given time. When a monitor loaded by the containerized agent, it is initialized to a healthy state. The state changes only if the specified conditions for another state are detected.

The overall health of a particular object is determined from the health of each of its monitors. This hierarchy is illustrated in the Health Hierarchy pane in Azure Monitor for containers. The policy for how health is rolled up is part of the configuration of the aggregate monitors.

## Types of monitors

|Monitor | Description | 
|--------|-------------|
| Unit monitor |A unit monitor measures some aspect of the resource, application, or service. This might be checking a performance counter to determine the performance of the resource, or watch for a log record that indicates an error. |
|Aggregate Monitor |Provides a combined health state for similar monitors. Unit monitors are typically configured under a particular aggregate monitor. |

### Aggregate monitor health rollup policy

Each aggregate monitor defines a health rollup policy which is the logic that is used to determine the health of the aggregate monitor based on the health of the monitors under it. The possible health rollup policies for an aggregate monitor are as follows:

#### Worst state

The state of the aggregate monitor matches the state of the child monitor with the worst health state. This is the most common policy used by aggregate monitors.

#### Best state

The state of the aggregate monitor matches the state of the child monitor with the best health state.

## Understand the monitoring configuration

Azure Monitor for containers includes a number of key monitoring scenarios that are configured as follows.

### Unit monitors

|**Monitor name** | Monitor type | **Description** | **Parameter** | **Value** |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
|Node Memory Utilization |Unit monitor |This monitor evaluates the memory utilization of a node every minute, using the cadvisor reported data. |ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition<br> FailIfGreaterThanPercentage<br> WarnIfGreaterThanPercentage | 3<br> 90<br> 80  ||
|Node CPU Utilization |Unit Monitor |This monitor checks the CPU utilization of the node every minute, using the cadvisor reported data. | ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition<br> FailIfGreaterThanPercentage<br> WarnIfGreaterThanPercentage | 3<br> 90<br> 80  ||
|Node Status |Unit monitor |This monitor checks node conditions reported by Kubernetes.<br> Currently the following node conditions are checked: Disk Pressure, Memory Pressure, PID Pressure, Out of Disk, Network unavailable, Ready status for the node.<br> Out of the above conditions, if either *Out of Disk* or *Network Unavailable* is **true**, the monitor changes to **Critical** state.<br> If any other conditions equal **true**, other than a **Ready** status, the monitor changes to a **Warning** state. | NodeConditionTypeForFailedState | outofdisk,networkunavailable ||
|Container memory utilization |Unit monitor |This monitor reports combined health status of the Memory utilization(RSS) of the instances of the container.<br> It performs a simple comparison that compares each sample to a single threshold, and specified by the configuration parameter **ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition**.<br> Its state is calculated as the worst state of 90% of the container (StateThresholdPercentage) instances, sorted in descending order of severity of container health state (that is, Critical, Warning, Healthy).<br> If no record is received from a container instance, then the health state of the container instance is reported as **Unknown**, and has higher precedence in the sorting order over the **Critical** state.<br> Each individual container instance's state is calculated using the thresholds specified in the configuration. If the usage is over critical threshold (90%), then the instance is in a **Critical** state, if it is less than critical threshold (90%) but greater than warning threshold (80%), then the instance is in a **Warning** state. Otherwise, it is in **Healthy** state. |ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition<br> FailIfLessThanPercentage<br> StateThresholdPercentage<br> WarnIfGreaterThanPercentage| 3<br> 90<br> 90<br> 80 ||
|Container CPU utilization |Unit monitor |This monitor reports combined health status of the CPU utilization of the instances of the container.<br> It performs a simple comparison that compares each sample to a single threshold, and specified by the configuration parameter **ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition**.<br> Its state is calculated as the worst state of 90% of the container (StateThresholdPercentage) instances, sorted in descending order of severity of container health state (that is, Critical, Warning, Healthy).<br> If no record is received from a container instance, then the health state of the container instance is reported as **Unknown**, and has higher precedence in the sorting order over the **Critical** state.<br> Each individual container instance's state is calculated using the thresholds specified in the configuration. If the usage is over critical threshold (90%), then the instance is in a **Critical** state, if it is less than critical threshold (90%) but greater than warning threshold (80%), then the instance is in a **Warning** state. Otherwise, it is in **Healthy** state. |ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition<br> FailIfLessThanPercentage<br> StateThresholdPercentage<br> WarnIfGreaterThanPercentage| 3<br> 90<br> 90<br> 80 ||
|System workload pods ready |Unit monitor |This monitor reports status based on percentage of pods in ready state in a given workload. Its state is set to **Critical** if less than 100% of the pods are in a **Healthy** state |ConsecutiveSamplesForStateTransition<br> FailIfLessThanPercentage |2<br> 10 ||
|Kube API status |Unit monitor |This monitor reports status of Kube Api service. Monitor is in critical state in case Kube Api endpoint is unavailable. For this particular monitor, the state is determined by making a query to the 'nodes' endpoint for the kube-api server. Anything other than an OK response code changes the monitor to a **Critical** state. | No configuration properties |||

### Aggregate monitors

|**Monitor name** | **Description** | **Algorithm** |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
|Node |This monitor is an aggregate of the all the node monitors. It is a worst of monitor, and its state is the worst state of its child monitors<br> Node CPU<br> Node Memory<br> Node Status | Worst of|
|Node pool |Aggregate monitor |This monitor reports combined health status of all nodes in the node pool agentpool. This is a three state monitor, whose state is the worst state of 80% of the nodes in the node pool, sorted in descending order of severity of node states (that is, Critical, Warning, Healthy).|Percentage |
|Nodes (parent of Node pool) |The nodes is an aggregate monitor of all the node pools.It is a worst of monitor, and its state is the worst state of its child monitors i.e. the node pools present in the cluster. |Worst of |
|Cluster (parent of nodes/<br> Kubernetes infrastructure) |This is the top level monitor and is calculated as the worst state of its child monitors, (that is, kubernetes infrastructure and nodes). |Worst of |
|Kubernetes infrastructure |This monitor reports combined health status of the managed infrastructure components of the cluster. This monitor is an aggregate monitor and its status is calculated as the 'worst of' its child monitor states i.e. kube-system workloads and API Server status. |Worst of|
|System workload |This monitor reports health status of a kube-system workload. This monitor is an aggregate monitor and its status is calculated as the worst of its child monitor states (that is, the Pods in ready state monitor and the containers in the workload). |Worst of |
|Container |This monitor reports overall health status of a container in a given workload. This monitor is an aggregate monitor and its status is calculated as the 'worst of' its child monitor states i.e. Container CPU Utilization and Container Memory Utilization. |Worst of |
