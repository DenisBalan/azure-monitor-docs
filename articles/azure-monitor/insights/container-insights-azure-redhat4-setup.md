# Configure Azure Red Hat OpenShift v4.x with Azure Monitor for containers

Azure Monitor for containers provides rich monitoring experience for the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and AKS Engine clusters. This article describes how to enable monitoring of Kubernetes clusters hosted on [Azure Red Hat OpenShift](../../openshift/intro-openshift.md) version 4 and higher to achieve a similar monitoring experience.

>[!NOTE]
>Support for Azure Red Hat OpenShift is a feature in public preview at this time.
>

Azure Monitor for containers can be enabled for one or more existing deployments of Azure Red Hat OpenShift using the following supported methods:

- For an existing cluster using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/openshift?view=azure-cli-latest#az-openshift-create) or from the Azure portal in the Multi-cluster view.

## Supported and unsupported features

Azure Monitor for containers supports monitoring Azure Red Hat OpenShift as described in the [Overview](container-insights-overview.md) article, except for the following features:

- Live Data (preview)
- [Collect metrics](container-insights-update-metrics.md) from cluster nodes and pods and storing them in the Azure Monitor metrics database

## Prerequisites

- [Helm 3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) CLI tool

- [Bash version 4](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)

- To enable and access the features in Azure Monitor for containers, at a minimum you need to be a member of the Azure *Contributor* role in the Azure subscription, and a member of the [*Log Analytics Contributor*](../platform/manage-access.md#manage-access-using-azure-permissions) role of the Log Analytics workspace configured with Azure Monitor for containers.

- To view the monitoring data, you are a member of the [*Log Analytics reader*](../platform/manage-access.md#manage-access-using-azure-permissions) role permission with the Log Analytics workspace configured with Azure Monitor for containers.

## Enable for an existing cluster

Perform the following steps to enable monitoring of an Azure Red Hat OpenShift version 4 and higher cluster deployed in Azure. You can accomplish this from the Azure portal or using the provided script.

### Using script

1. Download and save the script to a local folder that configures your cluster with the monitoring add-on using the following commands:

    `curl -LO  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/OMS-docker/ci_feature/docs/openshiftV4/onboarding_azuremonitor_for_containers.sh`

2. Sign into Azure

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

    If you have access to multiple subscriptions, run `az account set -s {subscription ID}` replacing `{subscription ID}` with the subscription you want to use.

3. The following step enables monitoring on the specified cluster by using Azure CLI. Specify your Azure SubscriptionId, Log Analytics workspace region, cluster name, and context of Kubernetes cluster.

    `bash onboarding_azuremonitor_for_containers.sh <azureSubscriptionId> <azureRegionforLogAnalyticsWorkspace> <clusterName> <kubeconfigContextNameOftheCluster>`

    For example:

    `bash onboarding_azuremonitor_for_containers.sh 27ac26cf-a9f0-4908-b300-9a4e9a0fb205 eastus myocp42 admin`

### From the Azure portal

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the Azure portal menu or from the Home page, select **Azure Monitor**. Under the **Insights** section, select **Containers**.

3. On the **Monitor - containers** page, select **Non-monitored clusters**.

4. From the list of non-monitored clusters, find the cluster in the list and click **Enable**. You can identify the results in the list by looking for the value **ARO** under the column **CLUSTER TYPE**.

5. On the **Onboarding to Azure Monitor for containers** page, if you have an existing Log Analytics workspace in the same subscription as the cluster, select it from the drop-down list.  
    The list preselects the default workspace and location that the cluster is deployed to in the subscription.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you want to create a new Log Analytics workspace for storing the monitoring data from the cluster, follow the instructions in [Create a Log Analytics workspace](../../azure-monitor/learn/quick-create-workspace.md). Be sure to create the workspace in the same subscription that the RedHat OpenShift cluster is deployed to.

After you've enabled monitoring, it might take about 15 minutes before you can view health metrics for the cluster.

## Next steps

- With monitoring enabled to collect health and resource utilization of your RedHat OpenShift version 4.x cluster and workloads running on them, learn [how to use](container-insights-analyze.md) Azure Monitor for containers.

- By default, the containerized agent collects the stdout/ stderr container logs of all the containers running in all the namespaces except kube-system. To configure container log collection specific to particular namespace or namespaces, review [Container Insights agent configuration](container-insights-agent-config.md) to configure desired data collection settings to your  ConfigMap configurations file.

- To scrape and analyze Prometheus metrics from your cluster, review [Configure Prometheus metrics scraping](container-insights-prometheus-integration.md)

- To learn how to stop monitoring your cluster with Azure Monitor for containers, see [How to Stop Monitoring Your Azure Red Hat OpenShift cluster](container-insights-optout-openshift.md).
