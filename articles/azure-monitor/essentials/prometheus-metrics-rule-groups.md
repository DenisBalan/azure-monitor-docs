# Azure Monitor managed service for Prometheus rule groups
Rules in Prometheus act on data as it's collected. They're configured as part of a Prometheus rule group which is stored in [Azure Monitor workspace](azure-monitor-workspace-overview.md). Rules are run sequentially in the order they are defined in the group.


## Rule types
There are two types of Prometheus rules as described in the following table.

| Type | Description |
|:---|:---|
| Alert | Alert rules let you create an Azure Monitor alert based on the results of a Prometheus Query Language (Prom QL) query.  |
| Recording | Recording rules allow you to pre-compute frequently needed or computationally extensive expressions and store their result as a new set of time series. Querying the precomputed result will then often be much faster than executing the original expression every time it is needed. This is especially useful for dashboards, which need to query the same expression repeatedly every time they refresh, or for use in alert rules, where multiple alert rules may be based on the same complex query. Time series created by recording rules are ingested back to your Azure Monitor workspace as new Prometheus metrics. |

## View Prometheus rule groups
You can view the rule groups and their included rules in the Azure portal by selecting **Rule groups** from the Azure Monitor workspace.

## Enable rules
To enable or disable a rule, click on the rule in the Azure portal. Select either **Enable** or **Disable** to change its status.

## Create Prometheus rules
In the public preview, rule groups, recording rules and alert rules are configured using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates, API, and provisioning tools. This uses a new resource called **Prometheus Rule Group**. You can create and configure rule group resources where the alert rules and recording rules are defined as part of the rule group properties. Azure Prometheus rule groups are defined with a scope of a specific Azure Monitor workspace.


You can use a Resource Manager template to create and configure Prometheus rule groups, alert rules and recording rules. Resource Manager templates enable you to programmatically set up alert and recording rules in a consistent and reproducible way across your environments.

The basic steps are as follows:

1. Use the templates below as a JSON file that describes how to create the rule group.
2. Deploy the template using any deployment method, such as [Azure portal](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-portal.md), [Azure CLI](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-cli.md), [Azure Powershell](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-powershell.md), or [Rest API](../../azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-rest.md).

## Limiting rules to a specific cluster

You can optionally limit the rules in a rule group to query data originating from a specific cluster, using  the rule group `clusterName`  property.
You should try to limit rules to a single cluster if your monitoring workspace contains a large scale of data from multiple clusters, and there is a concern that running a single set of rules on all the data may cause performance or throttling issues. Using the `clusterName` property, you can create multiple rule groups, each configured with the same rules, limiting each group to cover a different cluster. 

- The `clusterName` value must be identical to the `cluster` label that is added to the metrics from a specific cluster during data collection.
- If clusterName is not specified for a specific rule group, the rules in the group will query all the data in the workspace from all clusters.


## Template example for a Prometheus rule group
To create a Prometheus rule group using a Resource Manager template, you create a resource of type `Microsoft.AlertsManagement/prometheusRuleGroups` and fill in all related properties. Azure Resource Manager template for a Prometheus rule group configures the group, and one or more alert rules and/or recording rules within the group. The rules are executed in the order they appear within a group. Below is a sample template that creates a Prometheus rule group, including one recording rule and one alert rule.
