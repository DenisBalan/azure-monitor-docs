# Monitor virtual machines with Azure Monitor: Alerts

This article is part of the scenario [Monitor virtual machines and their workloads in Azure Monitor](monitor-virtual-machine.md). It provides guidance on creating alert rules for your virtual machines and their guest operating systems. [Alerts in Azure Monitor](../alerts/alerts-overview.md) proactively notify you of interesting data and patterns in your monitoring data. There are no preconfigured alert rules for virtual machines, but you can create your own based on data collected by VM insights. 

> [!NOTE]
> This scenario describes how to implement complete monitoring of your Azure and hybrid virtual machine environment. To get started monitoring your first Azure virtual machine, see [Monitor Azure virtual machines](../../virtual-machines/monitor-vm.md), [Tutorial: Create a metric alert for an Azure resource](../alerts/tutorial-metric-alert.md), or [Tutorial: Create alert when Azure virtual machine is unavailable](tutorial-monitor-vm-alert.md). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Most alert rules have a cost that's dependent on the type of rule, how many dimensions it includes, and how frequently it's run. Before you create any alert rules, refer to **Alert rules** in [Azure Monitor pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/monitor/).

## Choose the alert type
The most common types of alert rules in Azure Monitor are [metric alerts](../alerts/alerts-metric.md) and [log query alerts](../alerts/alerts-log-query.md). 
The type of alert rule that you create for a particular scenario depends on where the data is located that you're alerting on. You might have cases where data for a particular alerting scenario is available in both Metrics and Logs, and you'll need to determine which rule type to use. You might also have flexibility in how you collect certain data and let your decision of alert rule type drive your decision for data collection method.

Typically, the best strategy is to use metric alerts instead of log alerts when possible because they're more responsive and stateful. To use metric alerts, the data you're alerting on must be available in Metrics. VM insights currently sends all of its data to Logs, so you must install the Azure Monitor agent to use metric alerts with data from the guest operating system. Use Log query alerts with metric data when it's unavailable in Metrics or if you require logic beyond the relatively simple logic for a metric alert rule.

### Metric alert rules
[Metric alert rules](../alerts/alerts-metric.md) are useful for alerting when a particular metric exceeds a threshold. An example is when the CPU of a machine is running high. The target of a metric alert rule can be a specific machine, a resource group, or a subscription. In this instance, you can create a single rule that applies to a group of machines.

Metric rules for virtual machines can use the following data:

- Host metrics for Azure virtual machines, which are collected automatically. 
- Metrics that are collected by the Azure Monitor agent from the guest operating system. 

> [!NOTE]
> When VM insights supports the Azure Monitor agent, which is currently in public preview, it sends performance data from the guest operating system to Metrics so that you can use metric alerts.

### Log alerts
[Log alerts](../alerts/alerts-unified-log.md) can measure two different things, each of which supports distinct scenarios for monitoring virtual machines:

- [Table rows](../alerts/alerts-unified-log.md#count-of-the-results-table-rows): This measure can be used to work with events such as Windows event logs, syslog, application exceptions.
- [Calculation of a value](../alerts/alerts-unified-log.md#calculation-of-measure-based-on-a-numeric-column-such-as-cpu-counter-value): This measure is based on a numeric column and  can be used to include any number of resources. For example, CPU percentage.

### Targeting resources and dimensions

By using dimensions, you can monitor multiple instancesâ€™ values with one rule. For example, if you want to monitor CPU usage on multiple instances running your web site or app for CPU usage over 80%. 
In the **Split by dimensions** section of the condition, you can split alerts by number or string columns into separate alerts by grouping into unique combinations. 

To create resource-centric alerts at scale (with a subscription or resource group scope), you can split by Azure resource ID column. When you want to monitor the same condition on multiple Azure resources, splitting on Azure resource ID column will change the target of the alert to the specified resource.

You may also decide not to split when you want a condition on multiple resources in the scope, for example, if you want to alert if at least five machines in the resource group scope have CPU usage over 80%.

You might want to have a view that lists the alerts with the affected computer. You can use a custom workbook that uses a custom [Resource Graph](../../governance/resource-graph/overview.md) to provide this view. Use the following query to display alerts, and use the data source **Azure Resource Graph** in the workbook.

```kusto
alertsmanagementresources
| extend dimension = properties.context.context.condition.allOf
| mv-expand dimension
| extend dimension = dimension.dimensions
| mv-expand dimension
| extend Computer = dimension.value
| extend AlertStatus = properties.essentials.alertState
| summarize count() by Alert=name, tostring(AlertStatus), tostring(Computer)
| project Alert, AlertStatus, Computer
```
## Common alert rules
The following section lists common alert rules for virtual machines in Azure Monitor. Details for metric alerts and log metric measurement alerts are provided for each. For guidance on which type of alert to use, see [Choose the alert type](#choose-the-alert-type).

If you're unfamiliar with the process for creating alert rules in Azure Monitor, see the following articles for guidance:

- [Create, view, and manage metric alerts using Azure Monitor](../alerts/alerts-metric.md)
- [Create, view, and manage log alerts using Azure Monitor](../alerts/alerts-log.md)

### Machine unavailable
The most basic requirement is to send an alert when a machine is unavailable. It could be stopped, the guest operating system could be unresponsive, or the agent could be unresponsive. There are various ways to configure this alerting, but the most common is to use the heartbeat sent from the Log Analytics agent. 

#### Log query alert rules
Log query alerts use the [Heartbeat table](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/heartbeat), which should have a heartbeat record every minute from each machine. 

**Separate alerts**

Use a metric measurement rule with the following query.

```kusto
Heartbeat
| summarize TimeGenerated=max(TimeGenerated) by Computer
| extend Duration = datetime_diff('minute',now(),TimeGenerated)
| summarize AggregatedValue = min(Duration) by Computer, bin(TimeGenerated,5m)
```

**Single alert**

Use a number of results alert with the following query.

```kusto
Heartbeat
| summarize LastHeartbeat=max(TimeGenerated) by Computer 
| where LastHeartbeat < ago(5m)
```

#### Metric alert rules
A metric called *Heartbeat* is included in each Log Analytics workspace. Each virtual machine connected to that workspace sends a heartbeat metric value each minute. Because the computer is a dimension on the metric, you can fire an alert when any computer fails to send a heartbeat. Set the **Aggregation type** to **Count** and the **Threshold** value to match the **Evaluation granularity**.

### CPU alerts
#### Metric alert rules

| Target | Metric |
|:---|:---|

| where Namespace == "Memory" and Name == "AvailableMB"
| extend TotalMemory = toreal(todynamic(Tags)["vm.azm.ms/memorySizeMB"]) | extend AvailableMemoryPercentage = (toreal(Val) / TotalMemory) * 100.0
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(AvailableMemoryPercentage) by bin(TimeGenerated, 15m), Computer  
```

```kusto
InsightsMetrics
| where Origin == "vm.azm.ms"
| where Namespace == "LogicalDisk" and Name == "FreeSpacePercentage"
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(Val) by bin(TimeGenerated, 15m), Computer, _ResourceId

| where Namespace == "Network" and Name == "WriteBytesPerSecond"
| extend NetworkInterface=tostring(todynamic(Tags)["vm.azm.ms/networkDeviceId"])
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(Val) by bin(TimeGenerated, 15m), Computer, _ResourceId, NetworkInterface 
```

## Comparison of log query alert measures
To compare the behavior of the two log alert measures, here's a walk-through of each to create an alert when the CPU of a virtual machine exceeds 80 percent. The data you need is in the [InsightsMetrics table](/azure/azure-monitor/reference/tables/insightsmetrics). The following query returns the records that need to be evaluated for the alert. Each type of alert rule uses a variant of this query.

```kusto
InsightsMetrics
| where Origin == "vm.azm.ms" 
| where Namespace == "Processor" and Name == "UtilizationPercentage" 
```

### Counter value
The **counter value** measure creates a separate alert for each record in a query that has a value that exceeds a threshold defined in the alert rule. These alert rules are ideal for virtual machine performance data because they create individual alerts for each computer. The log query for this measure needs to return a value for each machine. The threshold in the alert rule determines if the value should fire an alert.

>#### Query
The query for rules using the counter value measurement must include a record for each machine with a numeric property called **AggregatedValue**. This value is compared to the threshold in the alert rule. The query doesn't need to compare this value to a threshold because the threshold is defined in the alert rule.

```kusto
InsightsMetrics
| where Origin == "vm.azm.ms" 
| where Namespace == "Processor" and Name == "UtilizationPercentage" 
| summarize AggregatedValue = avg(Val) by bin(TimeGenerated, 15m), Computer
```

#### Alert rule
 1. In the portal, select the relevant resource. 
 1. In the Resource menu, select **Logs**.
 1. Write the query to find the log events for which you want to create an alert. Use  [alert query examples](../logs/queries.md) to understand what you can discover, [get started on writing your own query](../logs/log-analytics-tutorial.md) or learn how to [create optimized alert queries](../alerts/alerts-log-query.md).
 1. Run the query to make sure you get the results you were expecting.
 1. From the top command bar, Select **+ New alert rule** to create a rule using the current query using your workspace the alert Resource.
 1. The **Condition** tab opens, populated with your log query.
      :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-virtual-machines/log-alert-rule-query.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new log alert rule query.":::
 1. In the **Measurement** section, select the values for these fields.
      
    |Field  |Description  |Value for this scenario |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Measure| Log alerts can measure the number of table rows or combine and numerical value of a specified column. |Counter value|
    |Aggregation type|The calculation used on multiple records to combine them into one value.|Average|
    |Aggregation granularity| The interval used for aggregation.|15 minutes|
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-virtual-machines/log-alert-rule-measurement.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new log alert rule measurement. ":::
 1. In the **Alert Logic** section, select the values for these fields.
      
    |Field  |Description  |Value for this scenario |
    |---------|---------|---------|
    |Operator |  The mathematical operator to use in the logic.|Greater than or equal to|
    |Threshold value| The value that the result is measured against.|80|
    |Frequency of evaluation|The interval used for the query.|15 minutes|

    :::image type="content" source="media/monitor-virtual-machines/log-alert-rule-dimensions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of new log alert rule with dimensions.":::
### Number of results rule
The **number of results** rule creates a single alert when a query returns at least a specified number of records. The log query in this type of alert rule typically identifies the alerting condition, while the threshold for the alert rule determines if a sufficient number of records are returned.

#### Query
In this example, the threshold for the CPU utilization is included in the query. The number of records returned from the query is the number of machines exceeding that threshold. The threshold for the alert rule is the minimum number of machines required to fire the alert. If you want an alert when a single machine is in error, the threshold for the alert rule is zero.

```kusto
InsightsMetrics
| where Origin == "vm.azm.ms" 
| where Namespace == "Processor" and Name == "UtilizationPercentage" 
| summarize AverageUtilization = avg(Val) by Computer
| where AverageUtilization > 80
```

#### Alert rule
1. On the Azure Monitor menu, select **Logs** to open Log Analytics.
1. Make sure that the correct workspace is selected for your scope. If not, click **Select scope** in the upper left and select the correct workspace.
1. Paste in your query and select **Run** to verify that it returns the correct results. You probably don't have a machine currently over threshold, so change to a lower threshold temporarily to verify results. Then set the appropriate threshold before you create the alert rule.

1. Select **New alert rule** to create a rule with the current query. The rule uses your workspace for the **Resource**.
1. Select the **Condition** to view the configuration. The query is already filled in with a graphical view of the number of records that have been returned from that query over the past several minutes.
1. Scroll down to **Alert logic**, and select **Number of results** for the **Based on** property. For this example, you want an alert if any records are returned, which means that at least one virtual machine has a processor above 80 percent. Select **Greater than** for the **Operator** and **0** for the **Threshold value**.
1. Scroll down to **Evaluated based on**. **Period** specifies the time span for the query. Specify a value of **15** minutes, which means that the query only uses data collected in the last 15 minutes. **Frequency** specifies how often the query is run. A lower value makes the alert rule more responsive but also has a higher cost. Specify **15** to run the query every 15 minutes.
