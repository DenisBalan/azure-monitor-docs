SLO

SLI - From [OTEL](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/observability-primer/) or Service Level Indicator, represents a measurement of a serviceâ€™s behavior. A good SLI measures your service from the perspective of your users. An example SLI can be the speed at which a web page loads.

SLO from OTEL or Service Level Objective, is the means by which reliability is communicated to an organization/other teams. This is accomplished by attaching one or more SLIs to business value.

Log - From OTEL is a timestamped message emitted by services or other components.

A Distributed Trace - From OTEL, more commonly known as a Trace, records the paths taken by requests (made by an application or end-user) as they propagate through multi-service architectures, like microservice and serverless applications.
